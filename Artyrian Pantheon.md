## History 
Religion and faith are both largely fluid across the Artyrian archipelago, owing at least in part to its unique heritage of settlers from the city of [[Gatazka]] in [[Jolastokia]]. During the period of time surrounding the first expeditions to Artyrix, deities flourished among the people of [[Gatazka]], going so far as to even enjoy walking among the mortals calling the city their home. This loose, laissez-faire attitude towards the separation of mortals and the Ascended was carried with the early settlers to [[Machivelia]], where it quickly took root in the culture of the region.

## The Pantheon
Despite the dynamic nature of parts of the pantheon and regional nuances towards specific entities, some gods are generally considered more “stable,” although some from Artyrix wouldn’t go so far as to say they’re more powerful. The more stable gods tend to have a more consistent following with larger landmarks and temples than the “more circumstantial” members of the local pantheon. For clarity, many in Artyrix think of the slate of deities active in the region in two tiers: the Primes and the Satellites.

### The Primes
The Primes - or the prime deities - are those most responsible for forming the plane within which Artyrix resides. They are “stable” in the sense that most major cities have at least a small following or clergy committed to their worship, but less directly impactful in the daily lives of those in Artyrix. Among the ranks of the Primes are the following:

- Azuth
- Moradin
- Eldath
- Sehanine
- Talos

### The Satellites
Relative to the Primes, less is decisively known about the Satellite gods due to the dynamic nature of their power and transient nature of their attention. Some skeptics and critics of the Satellites have been known to call these entities “Adolescent gods” as to signal out their sometimes impulsive or even boastful actions. Historically, Satellites tend to get along better with mortals than with other deities. For this reason, more often than not, Satellites are found walking among mortals, basking in the reverence that accompanies their power. 

Due to inter-deity conflict and fights for power or control over domains - whether religious or territorial - Satellites tend to enter and exit the pantheon irregularly. So much so, that historians often struggle to differentiate which individuals are *actually* Satellites and which individuals are simply powerful and influential mortals acting as if they were truly divine.

Given these unknowns, the current very-much-incomplete list of known - or suspected - satellites across Artyrix include:

- [[Composis]]
- [[Teorsorg]]
