## [[Aoife]] introduction
 She wakes up on the Jolly Rogue, captained by the giff Captain Garvin (he has a peg leg), and Finny O'Malley (they/them halfling) is first mate. Finny expresses concern for Aoife because she has seemed distracted or lost recently, especially when playing music.
## [[Kailani]] introduction
 She is aboard the Misty Moon, piloted by Captain Dewey (human, seems nice!) and Sigmund (Siggy) Skinner is first mate (high elf). Captain Dewey talks with Kai again about the 'fine' she must pay for being caught as a stow away aboard his vessel.
## [[Bugsy]] introduction
 Bugsy is traveling on a transport vessel call the Caravan of the Seas. Zatara Goldthorn (beautiful half elf, men are intimidated by her competence) and Pug Grunk (orc) is first mate. A hobgoblin approaches Bugsy because he believes Bugsy could be responsible for his brother serving two life sentences in the [[Dimensional Penitentiary]]. They also speak about some of the politics in New Sigil, the hobgoblin is a member the Kismet, Bugsy is unaffiliated.
## [[Krystabald]] and [[Sybil]] introduction
They wake up aboard the Deft Quartz. [[Ralph Midcliff]] (a dwarven man) is captain and Penn Bickerknocker (gnome female) is first mate. We learn that they are heading to [[Rifterra]]. Penn asks them what they're planning on doing in [[Havangart]] and they seem a little dodgey.

All four vessel encounter sudden and dangerous weather and are thrown overboard! A large island appears from seemingly nowhere. We see 2 aggressive looking fish people, and another one on the shore of this newly formed island. After fighting and killing them we meet Taruk (a tubular triton guy) and learn that this is his shop, ([[Taruk's Tiny Tiki Taverna]]). He tells us the island is called [[Pontecita]]. Bugsy interviews Taruk and learns that there were some people (one particularly tall well dressed man) here just before the island went topside. We decode a puzzle which appears to provide directions to something....we follow them after taking a short rest.

During the rest, Kailani shares that pirates raided her home -- a monastery, and that they stole a very important rock from there. It seems likely she's headed to Khiage for this rock and revenge. Kryst looks at Bugsy's service pistol. 

After following the puzzle's directions we come upon a satchel with a ship's charter, its ledger, and some academic text about Kua-toa. The ship is The Blue Wave, under Captain Duke Natalus Starport, and it's from [[Pythinia]], seems to be mostly a merchant vessel, but they recently stopped in Havangart and procured arcane supplies. The text supports the idea of Kua-toa creating gods.

We continuing moving and encounter two bees and/or wasps, Karen and Susan. Sybil speaks with them and we agree to detour slightly to give their nest a wider berth. They warn about a large green worm and something that turns things to stone. After a little bit more travel we see the mountain!
