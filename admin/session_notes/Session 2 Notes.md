The group is heading up the mountain on [[Pontecita]], during which time [[Kailani]] and [[Aoife]] take a point of exhaustion. It’s around 6 o’clock in the evening, 6 hours after we crashed. (We learn that [[Bugsy]] is 42 and Aoife is 32 years old).  

As we head up to a plateau we notice rocks with heat coming off of them. There’s a wall with various colored stones that we need to climb. 

Kai and [[Kryst]] make it to the top first, and combat ensues with more fish people (Koa-toa) including a priest(ess..?) 
- Kai goes unconscious!
- We eventually defeat them and Bugsy and [[Sybil]] inspect some of the religious iconography they carried (a pendant with what looks like three mountains with a U-shaped ark running through them)

Kai kills a large bird that flies out of a hole - we proceed to eat it.
Bugsy and Sybil go investigate the cave. They find a charred fish person.

We learn about Kryst’s religion! He “worships” [[Zumaj]], an emerald dragon in the court of Sardior (a ruby palace in space), they’re all about discovery and give librarian vibes.

We learn that Sybil is from [[Sur'dame]], [[Dynistia]] and her last name is Devereaux. We share more semi-personal information and then bed down.

- Sybil and Kryst – 1st watch
- Bugsy – 2nd watch
- Aoife and Kai – 3rd watch

Sybil and Aoife wake up “diseased” , Kai is “cursed”!
We all head into the cave. 
Kryst “enhances” Bugsy’s revolver. 
In the cave we find a 2nd dead Koa-toa with 3 big slashes across their body. 

We find a map with our location and trade routes, and then farther in a small chamber with a teleportation circle! There is a book with several journal entries signed TE. 

[[Harverot]] – affiliated with the magic college.

Kai gathers up the gem dust and the map of where a boat may be!
