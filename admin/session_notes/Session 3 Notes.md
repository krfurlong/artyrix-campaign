We are traveling to the boat, we believe it be to an hour away on the southern coast, however, we also believe this volcano is about ready to explode!

We quickly make our way to the coast and check around the bog and “coast line” for the boat…no boat. 

Then we follow a set of footprints we think may have been the robed dude Taruk (from [[Taruk's Tiny Tiki Taverna]]) saw when the island popped up. We find it!

It’s covered in vines…but the vines are alive!

Kai gets hit and paralysis starts to set in. She kills the vine and becomes unparalyzed. Then the same thing happens to Aoife. Bugsy gets the final shot. 

He casts Detect Magic. There’s a magic mast.

We carry the boat out of the jungle then use logs to roll it along the shore, and take it down to the bog.

Skill Challenge to get it to the water:
- We pull as much through the mud as we can
- use a springy tree, and then
- blast the sand to create a channel.

We sail off the thing as the volcano starts exploding!

It’s a sloop! (with 50 hp, 15 ac) a chunk of island hits our boat so we take a bit of damage. 

As the volcano explodes we see arcane dust that also comes out. 

It sinks back into the water rather quickly!

[[Aoife]] thinks we are 3-4 days from [[Khiage]], that’s where we decide to head. We try to fish after realizing we have little to no food. [[Kryst]] creates a rod…[[Sybil]] uses a javelin, [[Kai]] just grabs some! And we come away from 2 days worth of rations.

During watch [[Bugsy]] and Aoife see a *huge turtle* and Kryst and Sybil may have made a mistake steering the boat.  

We wake up and notice that we have been completely turned around, also there’s a large black oak vessel about 3 miles behind up and closing in on us fast.

Kai is still cursed and her condition seems to be worsening just as quickly.
