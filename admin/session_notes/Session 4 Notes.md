The ship is 3 times the size of our sloop and is catching up to us quickly. The sails look like birds. [[Aoife]] has seen vessels like this (or maybe this one) in Southern [[Khiage]]. We decide to “surrender”. A French woman named [[Miranda Barnibas]] of [[The Black Lapis]] calls out to us. They use a large magnet to pull us into their aft.

We meet Miranda – she’s half elven with black hair in dreads, stones in her temples, and she carries a rapier. They’re headed to [[Corosiva]].

We ask if they have a healer, for [[Kailani]]. Small frog (grung) appears, their name is [[Shaman Zlup]].

We meet the rest of the crew: refer to [[The Black Lapis]] for more details

We are going with them to [[Corosiva]]. Our passage will be free if we can get them there by midnight!

Boat Chores:
- [[Sybil]] ties knots with [[Kaida]].
- [[Krystabald]] is fixing inventions with [[Vex Sparksong]]
- [[Kailani]] is sewing sails that were damaged
- [[Bugsy]] is talking with [[Shaman Zlup]]
- [[Aoife]] is cooking with [[Galin Sweetgrass]]. (Aoife steals rations) 

Kai goes to talk to Zlup, he offers to make her a wereshark (they tell her she would lose herself one every moon) and Kai agrees! 😲

Bugsy and Sybil talk about Kai’s options, Sybil shares that she’s seen undeath and she’s not a fan.

Sybil foes to talk to Zlup, they’re giving Kai over to Talos and “hopes she’s okay…”

## Kai's Close Call
Kai is in a spirit form, and sees a large shark. 
It scratches across her back and asks whether she want the curse removed or exchanged (she decides just a removal!) 
Kai ends up with **3 lightning bolts in her left palm** (possibly marking her by Talos)

There’s a craic at lunchtime! Kai comes back feeling better.

## Shadows from the Past...
Sybil notices [[Jaxxon Deepclaw]] still looking at her oddly. Jaxxon knows she is from [[Sur'dame]], says there’s a bounty on her head…her family is wealthy. 

Bugsy uses food art to share this information with Sybil. (side note: Bugsy has a tattoo that is a rabbit skull and crossbones with the words “rabid company”)

We discuss Sybil’s “bounty” or “reward” it’s **10,000gp**.

We learn that the crew was previously diving for dragon turtle scales and pissed the dragon turtle off, [[Arya Silverweb]] was killed in that expedition. 

They’re planning on selling the scales in [[Faciv]]. [[Krystabald]] casts Detect Magic and the hold lights up with magical energy. 

Sybil shares a lot of backstory: she left home, her granny taught her to lie, her granny told her family she “had passed”. Two sisters, Clara- older sibling “infirm” and Liliana- younger, the real leader 

Bugsy goes to to talk to Jaxxon, he saw the bounty in [[Charterstown]], [[Khiage]]

We discuss our group’s lineage, Bugsy declaring that most of us are half human half animal…which is just not accurate.

The dragon turtle is heading towards us, looking ready to fight.
