## Welcome to Artyrix!
- Quick overview of the campaign setting
- High level goal of sandbox campaign 


## PC Creation

1. Design your character at **level 3**.
    - We will roll for stats together at [[Session 0]]. TBD on which method we will use, but right now I'm favoring something with high variance but also "stronger" than Standard Array (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8; Avg: 12)
2. As a part of your unique lived experience, background, skill set, or back story, select one (free) feat. 
    - Homebrew feats/edits to existing feats allowed - just run it by me so they’re not disproportionately strong 
    - Here’s a [biased ranked list](https://arcaneeye.com/players/dnd-5e-feats-tier-list/) of all published feats as of Fall 2023 for your reference.
3. Select (or roll for) a [[Family Heirlooms]]
4. Roll 3d8 and multiply that value by 100. **You have accumulated that much in debt prior to meeting the party/beginning the campaign**
5. Write a backstory that answers at least the following:
    - Where are you from?
    - How old are you? What did you do before adventuring?
    - Do you have any goals or ambitions?
    - What does your family’s heirloom mean to you? Or is it just something you inherited and feel bad throwing away?
    - Who or what are you in debt to? What is the source of your debt?
