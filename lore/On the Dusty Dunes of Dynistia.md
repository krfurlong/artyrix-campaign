## On the Dusty Dunes of Dynist
*(A Shortened, Lilting Tavern Song)*

*(The tune should be a simple, repetitive, slightly bouncy jig or reel, suitable for a steady rhythm.)*

**(Chorus)**
Och, the heat and the wind and the whispering sand,
A desolate stretch in a desolate land!
I've slept with the scorpions and dreamt with the jackals, you see,
On the Dusty Dunes of Dynist, wanderin' free!

***

### Verse 1: The Thirst and the Well
My tongue was like leather, my boots worn to thread,
The sun was a hammer on my aching head.
When thirst had near claimed me, I saw a green shine,
A secret oasis, the water divine!

**(Chorus)**
Och, the heat and the wind and the whispering sand,
A desolate stretch in a desolate land!
I've slept with the scorpions and dreamt with the jackals, you see,
On the Dusty Dunes of Dynist, wanderin' free!

***

### Verse 2: The Traders and the Stone
A trader and dwarf gave me aid on the way,
They saw my poor state at the end of the day.
But dark, gaping caverns arose from the sand,
Stone arches of silence, a dread in the land.

**(Chorus)**
Och, the heat and the wind and the whispering sand,
A desolate stretch in a desolate land!
I've slept with the scorpions and dreamt with the jackals, you see,
On the Dusty Dunes of Dynist, wanderin' free!

***

### Verse 3: The Blight and the Shadow
I ran from a shadow that whispered my name,
A vile necrotic curse, a rotting gray blight.
It infected the living and clawed out their peace,
I knew I would fall when my running would cease!

**(Chorus)**
Och, the heat and the wind and the whispering sand,
A desolate stretch in a desolate land!
I've slept with the scorpions and dreamt with the jackals, you see,
On the Dusty Dunes of Dynist, wanderin' free!

***

### Verse 4: The Vision and the Grace
Just as the corruption came near for its claim,
A roar shook the dunes and a figure of flame!
A Leonin Dream Witch, with coat white as snow,
She shattered the darkness with one holy glow!

**(Chorus)**
Och, the heat and the wind and the whispering sand,
A desolate stretch in a desolate land!
I've slept with the scorpions and dreamt with the jackals, you see,
On the Dusty Dunes of Dynist, wanderin' free!

***

### Outro
So raise up your tankard and listen to me,
There is aid in the dust and a light in the gloom!
***(Spoken, with a thump on the table):***
To the Leonin Witch who saved me from doom!
To Dynist! *Huzzah!*
