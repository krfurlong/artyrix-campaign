## Background
Below is a record of founding events across the Artyrian Islands. Due to their distributed nature, and unique navigational quirks imposed the [[Eternal Sea]], much is unknown about the specifics surrounding even pivotal events in the history of Artyrix. Thus, most dates might be best considered estimates - unless otherwise noted with an asterisk.

Years/Time in Artyrix is generally measured as being before or after some epoch defining event. The most notable of such events was the "discovery" of  [[Jolastokia]]'s doorway in Sigil, leading to the subsequent influx of outlanders to the plane. That said, time and the Jolastokian/Artyrian plane certainly existed prior to the large-scale migration of others to the plane. Therefore, time and events are measured as either occurring in the Pre-Sigil Era (**P.S.**) or the Modern Sigil Era (**M.S.**). Artyrix's timeline, however, lands squarely in the Modern Sigil Era, as indicated in the timeline below.
