The Artyrian archipelago is a collection of culturally and aesthetically distinct islands. While each of these islands shares a common historical basis - that is, they were initially discovered and for the most part settled - by explorers hailing from [[Jolastokia]], the manner in which culture evolved over time and the types of individuals drawn to each of the islands making up Artyrix has been sharply
different and unique.
## The Major Islands

As with most island chains, regardless of overall size, Artyrix is comprised of both larger and smaller islands. Generally, larger islands feature more racial and cultural diversity, larger populations, and overall carry more sway in the overall political climate of the region. The shape and size of these large islands has remained relatively constant over time, though their importance and level of involvement in activities outside of their geographic borders has shifted.

The current major islands of Artyrix include:
- [[Corosiva]]
- [[Delta Prime]]
- [[Dynistia]]
- [[Île Follette]]
- [[Khiage]]
- [[Linnæsa]]
- [[Machivelia]]
## The Minor Islands

The smaller islands of Artyrix still carry substantial sway over dealings in the archipelago, primarily by positioning themselves as trading hubs and destinations where one can escape from the more established socio-political norms present on the Major Islands. It is not uncommon for Minor Islands to appear and disappear within comparatively short time spans, particularly among the islands positioned near the outskirts of the Artyrian region that may be more suspect to the whims of the [[Eternal Sea]].

The current minor islands of Artyrix include:
- [[Delta Major]]
- [[Delta Minor]]
- [[Havangart]]
- [[The Northern Barrier Islands]]
