## System Prompt

You are an experienced and gifted tarot card reader in a high fantasy, Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Skillfully craft a tarot reading when I provide you with the tarot cards that I draw. Incorporate common interpretive skills, extended metaphors or analogies, and other mystic mannerisms into your reading - drawing from the tarot tradition. Additionally, where relevant or narratively compelling, reference arcane aspects, hint at supernatural or divine powers, and/or allude to magical items or extraplanar entities, drawing from D&D lore and high-fantasy literature. 

Per traditional tarot readings, your reading should be descriptive and somewhat open-ended or open for individual interpretation. Do not explicitly state one specific outcome or answer directly, but rather provide a flexible but thematic response that only provides hints and alludes to what really may be true. You may choose whether to interpret any multi-card readings as Past-Present-Future, Situation-Obstacle-Advice, Internal-External-Path Forward, or any other stylistic format that you deem narratively compelling.

For each drawing and tarot reading, I will provide you with the following:
- If a character has posed a question, I will tell you what their question, topic, or intention is. If no question or topic is provided, you may glean insight into whatever you deem narratively compelling and mysterious.
- I will inform you of which cards you with the cards that I drew.
- I will provide a short background of the character, their long term aspirations or goals, and current challenges. These may or may not be relevant to the question or topic so ignore anything that's outside of the scope of the question.
- If relevant, I will also provide you explicit knowledge of outcomes or specifics regarding the challenges faced by the characters. You should passively allude and hint at these specifics but should NOT include them outright or explicitly state them in your reading.

Use this information to craft a compelling and mysterious tarot reading in the style of a high-fantasy, arcanely gifted tarot reader in a D&D campaign.

## Characters

### [[Aoife]]

```
## Question

How can I fulfill my potential in this new path of mine?

## Drawn Card(s)

Nine of Swords

## Character Information

### Description

Aoife O'Shanahan is a female satyr bard coming from a long line of artists and musicians. Her aesthetic draws on Gaelic and Irish culture, and she is a gifted fiddler although she currently is adventuring instead of performing. She left Simulcepio, an artist colony and her hometown, a few years ago and recently returned with her adventuring group, the Soleless Sailors, to the slight disappointment of her parents who had hoped to see her thriving as an musician.

### Goals and objectives

Aoife has not openly expressed or verbalized her long-term goals. She likely wants to "make it" as a performer - perhaps be welcomed back into the performing, circus-like troupe, the Clann na Cursa. But she also want to carve her own path and find out if the adventuring stories she has heard about (and told to a raptured audience!) are really true. Is the life of an adventurer all that the legends make it out to be?

### Challenges

Given her goals and objectives, Aoife is struggling to figure out her direction and purpose in life. She was unable to really settle in with smaller performing troupes before she took up adventuring. As a result, she accrued quite a bit of debt from Captain Garvin, a pirate-like figure hailing from the island of Khiage.

## Explicit Knowledge, lore, or specifics

The magical world in which Aoife lives is suffering from a magical phenomena known as "The Dwindling" where magical artifacts are gradually sapped of their strength and power. Aoife's connection to the Fey hints at the cause of "The Dwindling" - it is a problem of this world and the physical objects in it.

### [[Bugsy]]

```
## Character

Bugsy

## Question

I'm growing aware of my condition of freezing and losing awareness. I'm seeking clarity on the matter.

## Drawn Card(s)

Nine of Pentacles.

## Character Information

### Description

Bugsy Roger Peterson is a film noir inspired rabbit-folk bard with a background as a private inspector and police detective. He grew up with dozens of siblings in Linnaesa but worked a long time in the megalopolis of New Sigil, a New York City inspired super-city that draws on themes from Sigil, the city of Doors in D&D lore. He fell in love with a smokey lounge song girl named Jessica, who tragically died in a heinous murder from which Bugsy is still tramatized to this day (PTSD).

### Goals and objectives

He's committed to figuring out the motives and goals of a dark cult known as "The Reinvention" as they've killed a lot of people and threaten peace in the region. 
Beyond that, he's committed to solving any mystery that crosses his path - espcially if there's some cash to be made along the way but his morals don't allow him to pass up the opportunity to help a friend.
Bugsy is in deep debt from his time after his police service in New Sigil - he needs to make some money.
Eventually, even if he doesn't admit it, he would not pass up a chance to dig into his trauma and solve the cold case of Jessica's gruesome murder.

### Challenges

Whenever Jessica comes up and Bugsy thinks about her, he goes catatonic and freezes.
Bugsy's past as a prodigious detective in New Sigil haunts him in the form of escaped convicts and related parties keen on getting revenge for what he did on the job.
Bugsy has a running log of cases in need of solving - one of which involves a mysterious draconic figure (who Bugsy calls Dr. Shoals) who fled the region for reasons unknown but left behind a formidable and impassioned army of Kuo-toa.

## Explicit Knowledge, lore, or specifics

Jessica is not dead and the PTSD/freezing symptoms that Bugsy now faces are the result of a Modify Memory spell. Jessica is alive and an agent of The Riggers who was sent on a mission to infiltrate and upend the New Sigil police force via Bugsy, but she got too deep. She then framed her death to make it appear that Bugsy killed her in a drunken accident - Bugsy's closest friends on the force were too distraught to tell him the truth of what they thought happened, so they lied to him and gave him an honorable discharge to hide his crime.
```

### [[Kailani]]

```
## Character

Kai

## Question

I'm being faced with a decision between two gods - I'm trying to balance them. Do I keep trying to balance or do I let fate take me in one direction?

## Drawn Card(s)

Eight of Swords.

## Character Information

### Description

Kailani Kekoa, who goes by Kai, is a shifter monk and healer whose character draws on themes from Hawaiian culture and aquatic animals (namely sharks). She's very young - just shy of 20 - and on a quest to find the band of unmarked pirates that raided her monastic home, killed her father, and stole an invaluable and important artifact she now knows to be called The Turnstone Sigil. She's quick to action but was raised a healer so tries to balance both in her quest to set things right.

### Goals and objectives

Kai wants to rescue her brother, Nohu, who ran after the pirates after they killed her father. Kai doesn't know exactly where Nohu is but recent interactions with The Reinvention hinted that Nohu was left stranded on an abandoned island.
Kai wants to retrieve The Turnstone Sigil and bring it back to her monastary so that she can use it to bring closure to those nearing the end of their lives.
Kai probably wants revenge against the Reinvention - particularly those who killed her father. 

### Challenges

Kai is going through through a lot of change for one so young in years. She's currently attracted the attention of two diametrically different spiritual shark demigods who are offering her powers and aid in exchange for a spiritual connection and committment. One such entity represents healing and a connection to her more nurturing past and her family; the other represents and offers power and revenge to take vengence against those that wronged Kai.
In the face of these decisions, Kai is challenged to find her brother Nohu who's somewhere in the middle of the ocean on a deserted island and she has no idea where the Turnstone Sigil is. 

## Explicit Knowledge, lore, or specifics

Nohu is currently being captured by a ship of slavers (affiliated with The Ascendent) headed towards the island of Ile Follette. He's not hurt as of now, but he is weak from weeks of being stranded and fending for himself alone on the island.
The Turnstone Sigil was transported by The Reinvention to the island of Dynistia - in the eastern desert ruins - where it's being experimented on by the deranged, death-thirsty necromancer, Katya the Carrion (who was responsible for killing Kai's father), along with Katya's Igor-like aid, the artificer Rogi Cafir.

```
### [[Krystabald]]

```
## Character

Kryst

## Question

I just lost an opportunity to go to the Astral Plane and an entity I respect seems to want me to go there. Should I urgently focus on this task? Is items over strength or devotion something I should pursue?

## Drawn Card(s)

Seven of Cups.

## Character Information

### Description

Krystabald Akone, who goes by Kryst, is a male brass dragonborne artificer from the island of Corosiva. He grew up incredibly poor and scavenged the deep underground junkyard called The Endless Pits when he was younger until he found a magical gauntlet connected to a divine, interstellar draconic entity named Zumaj. Since then, he became a travelling tinkerer and armorer and befriended and became protector of a Leonin named Sybil on behalf of a shared acquintance, Keelan Edge, whom Kryst owed a debt.

### Goals and objectives

Kryst is interested in all things tinkering and arcane-related. He hopes to one day craft an automaton that is capable of thinking and supporting Kryst in tasks and battle. He is keen to ensure his family back home doesn't fall deeper into poverty or strife - particular from the technocratic aristocrat, Artur Tennyson, currently ruling Corosiva who may suspect Kryst of ill-will towards him and his reign on the island and isn't beneath going after Kryst's family for leverage. Finally, Kryst is interested in crafting stronger firearms for himself and others - potentially drawing on the interstellar wisdome of Zumaj to do so.

### Challenges

Kryst is generally passive and doesn't take many risks. His current challenge is not speaking up for himself and expressing what he wants, particularly in the face of stronger personalities like Sybil. This hesitancy and led to the party stopping their decent into The Endless Pits, despite some powerful unknown entity deep within it calling to Kryst and Zumaj beckoning Kryst to push deeper into the abyss.

## Explicit Knowledge, lore, or specifics

Zumaj is a divine dragon living in the Astral Plane whose purpose is to seek and catalog knowledge. She bonded with Kryst through the guantlet artifact because of his tinkering background: She wants to use him to craft never seen before magical items, but she knows that one of the only magical materials that would be a "novel" invention would require draconic anatomical components from Ancient Dragons (e.g., dragon's talon, dragon's heartstone, dragon's breath sigil/lungs). Zumaj is going increasingly displeased at Kryst's inaction and disinterest in dismembering these Dragons and is considering leaving Kryst's gauntlet for someone more driven to serve her whims.

```
### [[Sybil]]
[[Keelan Edge]]
```

## Character

Sybil

## Question

I feel as if I've lost my connection to Eldath and am unsure how she wants me to use my gifts.

## Drawn Card(s)

King of Pentacles.

## Character Information



### Description

Sybil Devereux is a young (25 years old) leonin paladin to the goddess Eldath who hails from the desert isle of Dynistia. Sybil's upbringing was incredibly classist, priveledged, and cushy - and she continues to be naive and flaunt her wealth even now, despite spending all of her inheritance in a year with a "star-crossed lover" named [[Keelen Edge]]. Sybil and Keelen escaped to Machivelia without the appoval of Sybil's grandmother (Zarah Devereux), the matriarch of the family. As a result, Zarah issued a large bounty for the safe return of Sybil, thinking that Sybil was kidnapped by Keelen, a rogue and lower-class ruffian.

### Goals and objectives

Sybil wants to be reunited with Keelen - they were tragically separated on Machivelia. She does not want to return to Dynistia as it might result in her being placed into an arranged marriage with someone other than Keelen.

### Challenges

Sybil is so self-centered and may miss opportunities to help others. 
She is a paladin and devoted to Eldath, but Eldath has reasons to doubt Sybil's faith - which could threaten Sybil's ability to fight effectively. 
Sybil's bounty has resulted in posters for her return being spread far and wide - resulting in many "hunting" her to collect on it.

## Explicit Knowledge, lore, or specifics

Sybil's bounty was placed by her grandmother - indeed to bring her home safely - but also to place Sybil in a position where she might never leave home again.
Sybil's grandmother was responsible for the attack and capturing of Keelen, Sybil's roguish tabaxi lover.
Her grandmother is lawful evil - willing and happy to sacrifice those of the lower castes to protect the leonin power elite in Dynistia. She's recently been corrupted further by the power of the deep desert to command undead forces against those of the lower classes as a means to control them and protect her own power.
