Riddle/Instructions - again seemingly hidden within a textbook entry:
> Whirlpools, unsurprisingly, are common among the waters of the [[Eternal Sea]], and as such, any experienced captain should know how to avoid them entirely. For those unlucky souls caught in the abyssal riptide, their fates are cast in stone: their paths never again destined to cross itself as the current pulls them ever inward and downward, encircling them until the meet their doom.

> We set off from from solid land facing the water blue
> Going as far as we could until the waters turned green.
> Yet the skies on the horizon had already turned black,
> Never more would we see the forests so green.

> The waters below churned and spewed ever azure
> While the fires held by deckhands burned red
> How dark things grew - like a fog made of soot
> How we yearned to see the bright rays of sun

> Yet there we were, sinking deeper into darkness
> Cursing our greed, our envy so green
> Such waters of night
> Our blood coursing crimson
> Only to dry the most darkest of shades

> I'll remember the peaceful waves of the sea.
> I'll remember my lover's sweet blush.
> Even if the sea takes me downward to death.
> I'll arise and warn others, my tale's like the phoenix,
> Arising once again from the deepest of sapphires.
