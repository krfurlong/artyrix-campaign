Title: A Confusing Courtyard Conflict
<hr>

> Recap.
## Situation
- Kai and Sybil are separated from the group
- [[Krystabald]] just got caught snooping (invisibly) around [[Arthur Tennyson]]'s mech suit; Alerted by robotic dog thing - combat about to ensue...

Kai and Sybil. You two are walking generally towards the center of town with the hopes of reuniting with the rest of your group. The conversation with Remus went about as well as you thought it could - sentiments you were sharing with one another before piercing out into the dark, late evening you both hear a screeching alarm. It's tinny and obnoxious, but nonetheless sends shivers up both of your spines. Nearly at the same time, [[Sybil]], you feel the medallion around your neck grow suddenly more weighted, as the sound of rushing water almost overwhelms you. Yet through it all, you hear a calm, resolute, but urgent voice reciting a verse you know almost by heart: 
> Danger and pain await those who disturb the scorpion's den...

...[] going by a code name Zeeq - appearing as a half elf (hat of disguise), otherwise a black dragon born clocks them running towards the action. Flips a coin, checks it before running in the same direction and towards them, on an intercept course. Gruff and direct, slight sound of air whistling while they speak - as if talking out of only one side of their mouth
_"I saw you arrive with that group that went into Tennyson's courtyard. If you're interested in getting across town to them more quickly, follow me and don't ask any questions."_

#### Resolution?
- City guard of 2 Gladiators arrive on the scene after 10 turns, 2 more arrive 1 minute later
- Tennyson likely enters the garage after 8 turns and would enter the mech to defend his home...
