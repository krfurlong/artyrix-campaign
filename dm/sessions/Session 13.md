Title: ...Jesus Kryst?
<hr>

## Recap
- Party names TE (Emberfall) --> [[Dr. Shoals]] and explore [[Underscrew]] seeking clues that may shed light on the identity of this increasingly dark figure
- [[Creatures from the Deep]] completed - Tellurah the Triton farmer provided some additional background on [[Dr. Shoals]]
	- Meets [[Physiro]] en route
- The party officially completed the [[Dead Teen Walking]] quest - selecting the Potions of Revivify reward from [[Faedyn Neyender]]
- The crew conversed with [[Excavator]] - the kobold follower (cultist?) of [[Krystabald]]'s brother, [[Quzy Akone]].

## Narrative starting
> The ebbing soft waves of the river upon which [[Underscrew]] is built slowly grow louder - a gentle alarm that leads you all to gradually wake up in [[The Anchor Bar]], a soft din of collegial activity stirring as [[Celessaryn Murkshire]] begins passing out bowls and cutlery for some standard breakfast fare. Upon seeing you all gradually wake up, she nods knowingly and begins dishing out 5 servings of whatever she had prepared - setting them out on the table you all had sat at the night prior. Before returning to the backbar, she goes over to XYZ and says politely: "breakfast is served, and worry not about the fare from last night - it was covered by the Neyenders as one final _thank you_ for all you've done"

### Delver and the area around the Pits

		- Bugbear and goblin duo in the process of getting thrown out by some bar regulars when the party arrives - grumbling about not being able to collect on what's owed
		- [[Foltal Akone]] (Kryst's dad) is setup in the corner - 2 empty glasses around him. Sort of just existing
			- [[Oza Akone]] (mother) passed away about 4 years ago - caught some nasty sickness that the family wasn't able to find medicine for (that they could afford)
			- Foltal suspects is was something she picked up when flirting with someone else at another bar; 
				- Destes thinks it was a reaction to something Quzy found in the Pits - harboring some resentment there...
				- That said, Foltal's gambling lifestyle sort of went away after Oza's passing...
- **Edge District**
	- [[The Hobby Pot]] - an enormous junkyard;
		- parts of it are organized almost categorically, but newer parts seem less cohesive
		- Run by [[Duncan]] - with the assistance of a contract from [[Arthur Tennyson]] who's now largely funding the operation
		- **"Mr. Bath Time"** - Constructed an enormous crane and series of alchemical baths - iteratively pouring...stuff into the pits to eat through layers of grime, metal, and generally make it softer for the diggers to plow through

		- **Scrapheap Shield**: A shield made from a piece of scrap metal, granting the wielder a +2 bonus to Armor Class. However, the shield's makeshift construction means it will shatter on a critical hit. Alt - the user can use a bonus action to make an attack with the shield (STR based for 1d4 + str damage).
