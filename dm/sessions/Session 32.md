Title: Find a Hag, Lose a Hag.
<hr>
## Recap
- Went to a show by the [[Clann Na Cursa]]!
	- Interacted w/ essentially all the folks there
	- [[Kryst]] got closer with [[Patsy]] - how nice!
- Party found [[Soneela]] over at [[The Gilded Lady]], all partook in [[Soneela Tarot Reading]]
	- Quests were alluded to, insights were had by all
	- A white furred and masked leonin figure seemed to catch wind of each reading, before holding [[Krystabald]] effectively hostage in his reading
		- [[Shir Shobh]] - the ghost lion, a term really only known by [[Hounga Kalfou]]
	- Combat ensued, they got out but with plenty of questions

## Intro
Soft sunlight cuts through the dew and mists of the early morning in [[Simulcepio]]. Sleep came to you all eventually but each of you struggled to find it at first as you mulled both the meaning of own reading and the new presence of the ghastly leonin figure that increasingly seemed to haunt you all and draw ever closer during the course of the readings. Soneela's readings reverberated with significance and power - shedding light on questions you held in your mind while revealing new unknowns of which you were unaware before...perhaps blissfully so.

You awake to the muted sounds of the town waking up as well - with carts beginning to cross-cross the center of town and friendly banter beginning to trickle through the cracks in the windows into the communal housing that you bedded down in. With a sense of unease but also security, you all begin to collect yourselves and take stock of your next steps for this day and beyond.

## Things around town...
### Grainne returns!
A few louder voices break out with "ah-ha!" and "welcome back!" as you look around and see a familiar trio: [[Aoife]]'s grandmother [[Grainne]] walking alongside [[Carth]] and [[Barclay]] back over the north-south bridge and into their respective home-shops: Steeped Remedies and Hardwood Carvers. 

Things they know:
- [[The Painted Turtles]] are doing much better back at [[The Fermenti Caverns]] and no longer are in need of services from [[Simulcepio]] to port supplies in from the outside
	- There are some real tensions between [[The Painted Turtles]] and the mychonid colony that lives alongside them from what the mychonids view as a dereliction of duty and betrayal of trust
	- Everyone is grieving the loss of the [[Quyllurkuna Agaricus]]  
- [[The Reinvention]] did in fact leave and not return
	- Some regions appear blighted and may require some time but they're ready to put in the work
- Even before Grainne and the duo left, hungry looking city-folk had started drifting in on longboats seeking food and provisions to bring back to [[Rifterra]]
### Mini-Quests
- Talk to [[Lord Maris]] about it, he's got some at the ready:
	- Sail across the swampish lake to make a delivery towards [[Hounga Kalfou]] - he's been working feverishly to get in touch with spirits from the beyond as of late
		- Or perhaps- he's finding fewer spirits in the beyond...
		- They seem frenetic, as if they are running from something or someone in the space between planes 
		- He's also finding that he's working harder to make this connection - breaking through that veil is requiring more and more of himself
		- Is it the work of [[The Dwindling]] - an escalation of sorts...
	- Fey-touched endeavor - retrieve some youth that went missing recently, past the southern bounds of town
		- Some encounter with the seasonal eladrin
	- de-barnacle and repair some river transport boats
		- Optional encounter with a kuo-toa shaman, tribeless, [[Rribiialp]]

#### [[Rribiialp]] Musings
- Premise: RP experience, Rribii was a shaman in the lake shoals of [[Lake Difidenzia]] surrounding [[Machivelia]] before their fellow kuotoa became captivated by the great drake that wielded power unlike anything they had ever seen before
	- Rribii never gave this figure the time of day but saw them strike down a cadre of more skeptical kuotoas with one arcane spell
	- Rribii knows this figure is draconically inclined - believes they can fly - but also were frequent sailors on the water
		- Interacted with the kuotoa flock, farmed them for their beliefs of godhood
		- Took copious notes on their expanding power, Rribii recovered one such scrap
			- See [[Pontecita TE Journal Entry]], second entry.
	- Also knows that a group of 20ish kobold bandits once tried to ambush this figure and carve out something from his chest - they didn't stand a chance but it seemed to shake him enough and leave him muttering about getting revenge, taking his rightful place among the halls of the Ruby Palace, and offing that pompous [[Zumaj]] once and for all.

#### Hauling to Hounga
- Premise: Hounga has been increasingly caught up in his abode and requires a steady stream of supplies. 
	- The recent unmanned vessels they sent his way have mysteriously capsized roughly 1/2 way across the waterway
	- Packages are water soluble - cannot withstand 3 exposures to the water;
		- Boat tips if it takes more than 10 damage in a turn; DC13 Dex save or all fall overboard
		- 25 damage to boat flips it entirely
- Encounter: Aunty Mossy Magpie (Annis hag) has slipped through the fey portal about a week ago and been farming supplies from the caches
	- She's set up on a boulder camouflaged (DC21 Perc) to discern she's there when not moving
	- Noxious lilypads puff relaxing gas on init count 20; venus fly cattails on the other rounds (DC16 Con or disadv on dex/str checks; DC 16 Dex or 2d6 damage slashing)
	- 2 eel hounds guard around her home as well
	- Things she's interested in stealing: spell components, meat/flesh
	- Her goals: reopen the passage to the feywild and get back home; Or find other hags to form a coven to terrorize some people and then get home
- Upon arriving Hounga: he's been working feverishly to get in touch with spirits from the beyond as of late.
	- he's finding fewer spirits in the beyond...he first started noticing the waning of spirits a few years ago but didn't think too much of it then
		- Might reveal a ream of calendars - ink marks of red/blue to indicate failures increasingly more likely
	- They seem frenetic, as if they are running from something or someone in the space between planes 
		- He's also finding that he's working harder to make this connection - breaking through that veil is requiring more and more of himself
		- Is it the work of [[The Dwindling]] - an escalation of sorts...Kalfou thinks it could be related
		- The few souls he's encountered in the past few weeks have all shown this frantic energy
- [[Hounga Kalfou]]'s awareness of the white leonin:
	- Communication through dreams very common in old civilizations - rumors have it that it was the primary form of long distance messaging in the ancient civilization of Gataz with the outer territories
	- Manifesting a physical presence in dreams not unheard of, but would requires a significant amount of power and control over the mind, body, and spirit
		- Not necessarily something he's super well versed in but there may be places in greater Artyrix that could be poised to do this
			- [[Arcanum Decetto]] in [[Machivelia]]'s capital city, [[Vecchia]]
				- Or the more druidic factions on [[Machivelia]] in [[Dellavolpe]]/[[Vixeraven]]
			- Mystics on [[Dynistia]] - likely outside of the major population centers

#### Tracking Down the Youth
- Premise: Hevli, female half-elf, is an artist in residence and lives in one of the row homes in the middle of town. She lives there with her son - a nature loving maybe 12 years old - named Morris. She's fairly hands-off in parenting per the rest of the town, but Morris hasn't been seen in a few days now
	- Morris was exploring the southern side of town - beyond the swamp/lake of [[Hounga Kalfou]]'s home
	- He traveled with his dog - a lithe white sheepdog who responds to Ghiacco. It's fiercely loyal to Morris and wouldn't leave the boy's side
	- Task: Figure out what happened and where the boy went - if possible return him, but if not, do not risk you or the boy's health and safety
- Tracking him down: you head out of [[Simulcepio]], hugging the swampy shoreline of Kalfou's lake as the low din of the town drifted away - lost amid the thickets of trees and shrubs now impeding your direct path back towards the town.
	- DC15 survival/perception: you see a set of small foot prints and paw prints, well preserved in the mud following the lake's edge for maybe 15 minutes before they abruptly turn inland - further away from the town
		- The trees continue to grow closer together as you leave the water's edge - and roots increasingly spring up at odd intervals, requiring you to look downward both to follow the tracks - now slightly fading in definition - and to avoid tripping.
	- DC18 survival/perception: you arrive in a small clearing - maybe 20 feet across - a break in tree canopy here allows a beam of welcome pale sunlight to filter in here, though the light casts an eerie if luminescent shade on those in the clearing. Three paths beyond the one that you just entered from seem to be present in the glen ^HERE
		- East: **correct** the path grows increasingly thick with thorny briars that any medium sized humanoid would either have to hew down or take 4d4 damage (piercing)
			- a small hole is visible - indicating a smaller child could have made their way through unscathed
			- DC20 perception - a white tuft of hair (canine) is caught on of of the briar thorns
		- South: on success, notably wouldn't see any tracks in the sand/mud pit
			- Muddy/sandy patch, which becomes a quicksand trap atop a Sand Spider lair
			- Lair actions: 
				- summon 1-2 swarms of spiders from inside the sand burrow
				- Sinking sands: ~10feet radial around the quicksand start to sink inward (strength save DC13 to be pulled into the quicksand)
		- West: Crows and carrion off on the distance, maybe 10 minutes away as you peering off
			- If pursued, the stench of death and decay begins to fill your nostrils
			- Undead ooze lies in wait as its digesting and liquifying a pile of prisoners who refused to bend to the whims of [[The Reinvention]]
			- written in blood on the size of a large tree root:
				- By Moradin's hammer, I shall not bend my faith absent the crusible of his mighty soul forge
				- (another hand): Mother of waters, hear my cries amidst this babbling brook - take me to your evergreen garden and help me find peace
			- loot in the bodies:
				- coin purses (visible): 300gp; 2 greater health potions;
				- hidden slightly: Devotee's Censor, rare (att) magic flail with engravings suggesting it was likely not crafted in Artyrix...
	- 30 minutes of hiking/ducking under thorns, you begin to hear a low soft whining of a dog
		- Trees here are so thick - replaced the thorns in most places and you're now squeezing through tree trunks to progress further into the woods
			- DC18 Dex/Strength checks to push through (athl or acro); if fail by 10 or more, you get actually stuck and begin to take 1d6 force damage as the trees themselves begin to crush you... once per minute
		- Break through to another clearing - no sunlight here though, just an incredible amount of moss - and Ghiacco whining and laying the in middle of the 30ft clearing
			- 4 stone statues of seasonal eladrin are covered by the densest of moss at the cardinal direction
			- the ground here is mossy, but DC20 perception reveals stone underneath, and inscriptions:
				> Two roads emerge, sprung out of the woods
				> Use wisdom and caution in choosing you should
				> 
				> With one you act swiftly, solo, alone
				> And give of your essence, your vigor, your bone
				> Affix your palm 'gainst the center of stone
				> Hold it there solidly, move not from that zone
				> For time is fickle, a day in the fey you shall owe
				> Yet clocks here tick different, err not or you shall feel woe.
				> 
				> The other requires numbers to aid
				> In meeting the needs of the eladrin this day
				> Their moods are temporal like weather and time
				> Yet each is marked with their season of life
				> Appeal to them with what makes their heart sing
				> And they'll welcome you gently to the realm of their kin. 
				> 
			- Rule: each of the seasonal eladrins AOE effects must be performed simultaneously to unlock the portal to the fey
				- Winter: Cry before them
				- Spring: dance before them
				- Summer: Fear, turn your back to themex
				- Fall: charmed; kiss the statue? lock eyes with them/bow before them?
			- DC25 Perception: Morris can be seen in the twilight light caught in the ethereal realm - held unharmed but very much afraid by 1 Yeth hound.
				- If any eladrin are disturbed, 1 Yeth hound emerges to join them in combat with Morris in tow
