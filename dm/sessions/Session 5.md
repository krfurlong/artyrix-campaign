Title: *Upon a Shitted Ship I Sit*
<hr>

> As the realization dawns upon your group, calls from others in the crew, first from Jaxxon, the tabaxi navigator - though quickly followed by terse, pointed orders from [[Ocinara Blacktide]] to the other crewmates onboard [[The Black Lapis]]. As if anticipating his order, [[Eilif Talbjorne]] - the goliath helmsman - shifts the boat ever so slightly, as if to catch a wind he knew was there but had been avoiding until this very moment. As the ship veered ever so slightly to the starboard, winds whip up around you - filling the billowing sails of this vessel to their fullest as you lurch forward. As if by cue, Captain [[Miranda Barnibas]] exits from her quarters, flinging the ornately carved dark wooden doors open with a crash as she simply mutters, almost under her breath: "Alright thzen. Je suppose we will hav to fight our ways out once again. Ocinara, status report."

Those of you on deck hear almost a verbatim recounting of the orders you all just witnessed the first mate and quartermaster yell out. Miranda looks up to the crows nest and with a mere cock of her head, wordlessly inquires up to the navigator..."Likely just under an hour, captain. We shant reach [[Corosiva]] before then, but it'll be close...."

With this, Ocinara chimes up: "Recall captain, the port at [[Faciv]] is on the south-western end of the island, so they'll see us well before we're able to dock - it's possible we'll get lucky and some scavengers will sail out to support us in fending off the beast. But we shouldn't expect the support unless things turn truly dire for us - they're likely more interested in the wreckage of the Lapis than the carcass of the creature."

But a moment passes, as Miranda's eyes drift towards the horizon: first the one that lays before you, presumably [[Corosiva]] just past eyesight, then swiveling around to the horizon that you all just left behind. "Aye..." she whispers. Turning again, this time not to the horizon but rather, to her crew - and all of you, with a voice that echoes and reverberates through the air and through the ship itself:

> Well friendz - it seemz our luck may be tested onze more. We have staved and survived an attack like thiz before, and have recent memoriez that we can draw from to learn from...pazt mistakes. (she pauses a bit a looks out to the sea...). 
> 
> Ocinara, direct the crew to take defensive positions. Ensure our...guests are included as their fate seems even more intertwined with ourz now. 
> 
> Today, we'll see to it that Arya's sacrifize has not been in vane. She'll be remembered - we'll all be remembered - and go down in legend as the crew that stripped the dragons of the zee of that which is most precious to them. That is what awaits ups this day - glory, remembrance, and a chance to grieve those we've lost along the way. But only if we succeed! Fight for your fellow crewmate, Fight for Arya, Fight...for [[The Black Lapis]]!

Hurrah! Here here! For Arya! - cries ring out from others on board, and below deck.

In rumbling **draconic** once it reaches 1k feet off, you here reverberating through the Black Lapis:
> Mortal pests - clumsy raider - nest defilers. My mate lays bleeding and weeping fathoms below on your actions and haste alone. No more shall you pollute these waters with your presence. I will not rest until your play vessel is in ruins and you all are cast off from the sea and from this existence. You will pay the ultimate for what you have done and for that which you continue to do. *a blast of steam and fire jettisons out from the waters behind you, roughly 1k feet behind you*


## Arriving at Corosiva

- [[Port Ruggine]] is the main port/access point to [[Corosiva]], and particularly the main/capital city of [[Faciv]]. 
	- Harbormaster is a moderately mech-ed out dwarf Steward [[Rast Brecchiason]] with a prim/proper grey manicured beard, long grey hair pulled back (Gandalf-like).
		- Walks around in robot-like extensions, stands closer to 8 feet tall because of it; friendly but very mercantile

### [[Faciv]]
(Eventually transition this to public page)

Main description: Upon exiting the hubbub of the port and harbor, you all gaze ahead of you and upward to a sight largely unfamiliar to the majority of you. Before you, perched on top of what seems to be a mossy and strangely patterned plateau is what you can only assume to be the large city of [[Faciv]]. As you draw slightly nearer to the city, following the path of merchants and the only road in sight, your eyes adjust and realize the patterns at the distance are not cosmetic, but rather the plateau itself is _threaded_ like an enormous screw - with grooves so wide that you begin to clock and follow movement of peoples and carts as they slowly follow the circular grooves ever upward until reaching the top: the city of [[Faciv]] itself.
