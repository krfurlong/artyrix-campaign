Title: A Twisted History for Underscrew
<hr>

## Recap
- [[Aoife]] learns to sail from [[Osiris Siltguard]] at the harbor of [[Underscrew]] despite miffing some of the more "book smart" questions posed by her instructor
- The crew reunite [[Remus Neyender]] with his mother [[Faedyn Neyender]], who...just so happened to be in [[The Anchor Bar]] in [[Underscrew]] - seeming connections between her and [[Celessaryn Murkshire]].
- The group clears out the Salt demon (from [[Lord Emberfall]]/the long, dark haired humanoid they first heard of on [[Pontecita]] in [[Session 1]] and [[Session 2]])

## Errands around town
1. [[Creatures from the Deep]] errand to adjust the misaligned Siphon and get farming functional again
2. Finishing the [[Dead Teen Walking]] questline with [[Faedyn Neyender]] offering up one of the noted rewards as thanks for clearing out the cabin that was once the Salt Devil's...
3. Engaging with [[Celessaryn Murkshire]] re: the giant holding up the city
	1. She's keen on sourcing another tome of clay golum to give the current giant-fomorian a break;
	2. Was able to find
4. Fallout from the Salt Devil combat: [[Hector Gilfoot]] (cannibal rabbitfolk)
	1. Yes he went up and around the cabin;
	2. He may have been using it to hold bodies...but in reality, he hasn't been actively seeking out "victims" for a while. Not since getting to [[Corosiva]] at least
 
## A delayed reunion?
After the party does a task in further aiding [[Underscrew]], [[Excavator]], a bronze kobold follower of  [[Quzy Akone]] and he arrives to meet up with the party. Is waiting for them at [[The Anchor Bar]] 
(Late arrival) Bronze kobold named [[Excavator]] (goes by Exca), sent as a representative of [[The Lost Change]], friend/follower of [[Quzy Akone]].
		1. Has info on Quzy's background, their quest/creed
- Exca is dressed plainly - in grubby, dirty clothes, grease stained - and has a pick axe strapped to his back
- Quzy is dressed nicer - wearing dark robes that largely mask his personal effects- but you all see multiple long curved dagger and sharpened pieces of metal poking out from beneath the folds. When you first see him in the Anchor, he's at the main bar - deeply engaged in conversation with [[Celessaryn Murkshire]] - the barkeep.
- Apologizes for taking so long to arrive - had a hard time getting away from the Pits, esp since he'd been hanging around [[Faciv]] so much the past few days.
	- Trying to clear up a debt owed by [[Destes Akone]]
- Asks why [[Krystabald]] hasn't responded to any of his brother's messaged 
	- 
### Quzy's Ambitions (according to Exca)
1. History: was engaged in largely petty crime for the few years after Kryst's departure. Got engaged with some gangs active in the Pits - [[The Scrapborn]], [[Sewer Scourge]], [[The Rust Crows]] - gained some decent reputation with them all and moved on without much bad blood, while earning some money that he funneled back to [[Destes Akone]], who used it to finance the tavern.
   Things changed when he was in-between groups though and going on a deeper dive into the Pits...more looking for clarity and purpose than anything, hoping for a miracle. 
   He found first a viridian-silver colored gemstone that seemed to reflect and catch the light around him but _something_ spoke to him in that moment and tldr, he threw it down into the Pits.
   A moment later, floating up from the Pit was **this** (pulls out a strange looking coin with an almost metallic looking gem embedded within it). From that point on, Quzy's streak of luck was incredible at the gambling table and in the Pits, whenever he was using the coin. He says it speaks to him and he tells stories of how it's our duty to protect the forces beneath us from those who was to press ever deeper.
	   _An ancient Electrum dragon is the patron of Quzy/those who follow the coin, though Quzy does not fully know this to be the case._
	Tracking this info in the quest: [[Such a Pity...]]
1. Goal: spook off [[Arthur Tennyson]]'s forces for good; end vertical drilling in the Pits entirely if possible, focusing rather on pushing out horizontally instead.

## Beyond [[Underscrew]]...
 - Recent scuffles between some sailors and the artist-merchants on [[Havangart]]. Allegedly there were some rumors they sold a bad batch of drugs that they were then loathe to admit, lest it ruin their reputation - likely out of [[Rifterra]].
	 - Beginnings of of a maritime blockade originating out of [[Athenae]] around the isle: [[Hung Overboard]]
- Dredging activities in the south of [[Khiage]] seems like they're building something - perhaps intending on extending a trainline out as to not be so dependent on the Eternal Sea?
- A monastery in the north-western region of [[LinnÃ¦sa]] once known for their pacifist and therapeutic techniques had some rogue members who turned aggressive. Reports of highly skilled mariners traversing the seas and single-handedly sinking ships without reason piled in a few months ago but have since slowed up.
	- **Kai's brother did indeed attempt to parlay with [[Osiris Siltguard]] and his crew, but his true intentions were found - he was marooned, otherwise unharmed, because of this somewhere between the east of [[Machivelia]] and [[Dynistia]]. 
	- Osiris did not kill Kai's father, nor was he engaged in the attack on the monastery. 

## Beyond Corosiva
1. Shipwrecked individual, pigeon-folk (Luma race), ~20s, named: Pirio. Caught up in a spat between pirates and some bardic troupe from [[Havangart]].
	1. Pirio's ship was traveling from [[Ruddy Rock]] up towards [[Corsair's Cove]] on a diplomatic mission, information gathering affair on behalf of [[The Parliament]].
	2. Likely drifted for the better part of a day - conflict was in the north west.
2. Sea monsters?
	1. Young Mercury dragon named Hydrargio playing in the waters, if they can be detected.

## Next steps
- saving [[Faciv]] for later - long term thing to address?
- 

## Notes
- Party is now calling "island man" --> Dr. Shoals ([[Lord Emberfall]])
