## Recap
- Party widely explored [[Simulcepio]], hitting effectively every side quest
- Bartered with Aunty Mossy Magpie to transport supplies to [[Hounga Kalfou]]
- Learned about the mythical creature [[Shir Shobh]], the ghost leonin
- Party traveled into the forest to track down child (Morris)
	- Killed Aunty Mossy too :( 
	- Party retrieved Devotee's Censor magical item
## Intro
As you take a short rest in the midday warmth, you all note the forest features that surround you are familiar and yet different - as if exaggerated in color and stature from the trees that you passed by earlier. The change isn't so much unwelcome or threatening as it is unsettling. Things are familiar and yet different - birdsong is both softer and yet more distinct. A crispness to the air around you cuts through and shocks your lungs despite the overall dankness and humid weight of the somewhat swampy environment around you. Your short rest ends as you arise and trek back towards the fork in the trail - retracing your steps to where you first lost sight of the tracks of the youth lost in these strange woods.

## Continuing the Search for Morris
Refer back to [[Session 32#Tracking Down the Youth]]

- Morris was taken by the Summer Eladrin statue for disrespecting the Court of Summer
	- Morris looked directly at the statue for an extended period of time (not fearfully)
- Eladrin sent 2 yeth hounds to trap the child; ethereal eladrin also runs in from the Deep Ethereal upon combat beginning (Ghost stats; looks like Summer Eladrin)
	- Cursing/defiling the same statue provokes/taunts them to send the yeth to the material to retrieve them
- When traversing plans, one of yeth hounds eyes flash bright purple; then stays out for a turn to regen
	- when killed, eyes retain their purple light energy until used (e.g. squashed/thrown on grown like glass bottle)

## Returning back to [[Simulcepio]]
- [[Lord Maris]] happy to provide river transit/shoreline vessel back to [[Rifterra]]
	- Journey to Rifterra takes roughly 8 hours
## Journey to [[Rifterra]]
> The waters of the [[Eternal Sea]] around [[Havangart]] are calm as you sail out of the river system leading away from [[Simulcepio]]. Hugging close to the shoreline, the waves don't bother your shallow river-vessel and for the first time in a while, the sun breaks out through the overcast skies and warms your faces. 
 
Anything anyone what to do?
- No signs of [[The Reinvention]] ships anywhere in sight
- wildlife and fish appear to be coming back to the ecosystem

> As your trip nears completion, you begin to see the [[Rifterra]] harbor start to come into view. Unlike your previous arrival to the large city, a handful of ships - not particularly enormous, but larger than your own - appear recently docked, all flying the colors of [[The New Transit]]. Life seems to have returned to the dockside as figures move quickly up and down, hauling boxes and crates as if by second nature. 
> As your river skiff drifts nearer, a familiar tan-coated tabaxi waves you down and directs you into an appropriate berth along the docks ([[Absynian Lapwater]], mayor/dock-master) and calls out:

>bonne soirée! bienvenue traders...(his voice trails off)
>By the purse strings of the Muses - it is you lot! Mon dieu! Welcome, welcome indeed! I had hoped that you would return so that I had ample opportunity to thank you! 
>Time runs odd without the regular cadence of trade on which to rely but...maybe a few days after your departure from the city, a dark vessel sailed by flying a white flag of parlay. whoever those seige bastards were, they cleaned out town from the creatures they left behind...

Other things [[Absynian Lapwater]] knows:
- They sailed off to the north-north east.
	- Didn't say much but they mentioned wanting to catch up with the rest of their group and leader (the boss)
- warehouse opened up immediately - helped provide food for everyone in the short term
- Trade opened up - rates from [[The New Transit]] are near highway burglary 
	- but Absynian has sent ships/messages out to northern [[Khiage]] and [[Athenae]] that the siege has been broken.
	- He expects cheaper food to begin arriving in the next few days
- Some from southern [[Havangart]] began returning home, but real tensions exist between [[Absynian Lapwater]] and the mages in the [[Hilltop Observatory]] which effectively left them to die by themselves

## Travelling From [[Havangart]]
Times to...
- [[Rusted Keys]] --> 3 days
- [[New Sigil]] --> 12-14 days
	- Southern cities in [[Île Follette]] -->8-9 days week

#### Kobold Boarding Party
> The night watch starts peacefully as the moon reflects sporadically across the choppy waters of the [[Eternal Sea]]. 
> 
> Perception DC13 - As the hours stretch on, an odd shape appears in the water - slightly bobbing up and down. It's only upon getting closer to it that you recognize it as ice - this piece maybe about a foot across in size and certainly not large enough damage your ship.

DC18 --> to each size of you, you also see two larger pieces of what you think to be ice. There are larger and mostly submerged but unlike the errant small bergs in front of you, these seem to move on their own accord - and they're swiftly moving in your direction, vectoring on a curiously precise intercept path ~100 feet away.

Perception DC14: A thump from the back of your shift, as a single cloaked figure rises, they are tall and lanky
	("scary/fake" name: Tundrax the Arbiter)
	real name: (chief): Zamboni; 
	torso kobold is: Icktray
	feet is: ick-pick
They've been sent on a vision quest by [[Zumaj]] to retrieve the artifact held by [[Krystabald]] -- they are certainly [[Zumaji]] through and through.

> Hello fair adventurer. I am Tundrax, the arbiter. And I am charged by our great draconic librarian in the Ruby Palace and come to relieve you of that which burdens you. I speak of course of [[Zumaj]] - the Viridescent Archivist bids those in our order to act when faced with those who would sit on knowledge and use the gifts that Zumaj provides to advance their astral will. 
> 
> Take comfort, lowly inventor: you have chances to redeem yourself. But until that time, Zumaj requires that we extricate the gauntlet you wear. Time is impossibly short for us here in Artyrix - and Zumaj grows wearing of your trifling inventions that do not advance discovery and creation itself.  
> 
> Join us if you feel ready - we aim to strike at the heart of a silver dragon in but a few days. Prove yourself there and perhaps the Drake of Knowledge Lost will deem your soul worthy of their unmeasurable power and talon-tinged artifcats.

**Combat**:
	- 10 white kobolds arriving in waves of 4-3-3 at initiative ct 20.
		- Init: 15, 5, 10
	- Icktray and IckPick - both have AC+2
	- Chief
