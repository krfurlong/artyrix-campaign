## Recap
- Bugsy curse save: Counter is at **6 (out of 24)**
	- **Wis save 11 required each time he falls asleep**
- Party was found in the night while resting by a druidic scout of [[The Reinvention]]
	- Bugsy and Aoife nearly were pulled all the way to [[The Fermenti Caverns]] while asleep
- Group found the large encampment around Fermenti, surrounding the Great Willow
	- Stealthed into camp by lugging supplies from the docks (western side)
	- Split up to get to the mouth of Fermenti...
		- Sybil and Bugsy are in the mouth of [[The Fermenti Caverns]]
		- Panther is tracking Aoife and Kryst above ground
		- Kai is also waiting above ground (is hidden/stealth)
		- Osiris: Do we want to do this the easy way or the hard way?

## Intro
Kryst - the sights of the sounds of the camp come fully into focus as time seems to slow down. Immediately around you, you estimate there must be no fewer than 50 tents, each housing 1-2 fighters. The groans and low grunts of undead fill the gaps in the otherwise normal din of the encampment's noise. Nearby, rows of tables are setup mess-hall style in front of what appear to be a makeshift gallows - dinner and a show takes on a very different connotation - as emerging from his ornate tent nestled under the enormous roots of the Great Willow tree is [[Osiris Siltguard]] - alerted to your presence by the large automaton just moments ago - as they stride forward confidently and with a heighted sense of alertness, asking: "Are we going to do this the easy way or the hard way...?"

### Osiris RP Info
> Welcome, Outsider. Your presence here seems to have come to the attention of my colleague, [[Tau-0]]. And your visage matches the description of one traveling nearby that our scouts encountered this past night (**he glances up at the Panther**). We know good deal of where you came from but not why you are here nor your intentions. I am busy, with other more pressing matters at hand. Speak quickly and plainly: "Why are you here, and what pithy reasons can you provide so that I do not rend your soul from your body this instant?"

1. Information known:
	1. The druid scout ([[Vernix Dendronicus]]) found the party last night and nearly retrieved 2 of the members of interest
	2. Was looking forward to carving through the last layer of fungi defenses today/near future
		1. Faced repeated setbacks between [[The Painted Turtles]] druidic circle and local protesters who somehow managed to find their ways into the Caverns
		2.  3-4 other denizens that [[Aoife]] recognizes by face but not by name recently brought up and are currently in cages/
			1. Tiefling bonded pair: Ethos (Male, royal blue) and Egalatia (female, dark purple) most recognizable
		3. [[Don Don]] - one of the prime members of [[The Painted Turtles]] was captured yesterday/day prior, representing a turning point in the siege
2. Info not known:
	1. Townspeople from [[Simulcepio]] are infiltrating the Caverns via some other tunnel network - not sure how they get there or where the tunnel lets out but he's been organizing small patrols to try to scout out the opening and collapse it.
	2. How many fighters are down below?
3. Wants/motivations:
	1. End the pests coming from [[Simulcepio]]
	2. Gain access to the bottom level of [[The Fermenti Caverns]] - to appease [[Jasad Peatmire]] and enable him to commune with his father
	3. Would value intel on those below - without a fight would be convenient

### [[The Reinvention]] Brand mechanics
- You can use a bonus action to enable/disable your connection to The Beyond, or the web of others bearing the brand. 
	- When you are connected, you have disadvantage on all charm/charisma checks vs. superiors in the cult
		- Immediately fail on any Dominate person spells cast against you
	- While connected, you can freely communicate mentally with all other connected creatures within 60 feet
		- This includes all **undead**, branded creatures
- You may cast the following spells:
	- Chill Touch (cantrip)
	- Cause Fear (1/day)
	- Whither & Bloom (1/day)

Magical effects of the brand can be dispelled with a DC15 Dispel Magic - save.
It explodes with a necrotic blast: caster of spell takes 4d6 necrotic damage - Branded individual takes 8d6. CON Save DC18.
## Camp Combat Mechanics

If combat ensues, regions are activated in a radial order - pending where it's occurring

CAMP reacts on Initiative count 20.
1d4 turns to prep the region.
Distractions within the region can delay/slow the getting ready process.
Random nearby region potentially joins the fray if DC12 perception check.
	DC -3 for each region that's currently "active" ish.

### Distractions
- Within combat, distraction have the potential to delay preparations or to lure others in
	- Delayed preparations -- play by ear
	- If goal is to lure others: Contested check vs Insight of the region, +0, +3, +5, +8 based on degree of seniority 
- Outside of combat, distractions could get used for luring forces elsewhere
	- Contested check vs Insight of the region, +0, +3, +5, +8 based on degree of seniority to determine outcome
## Caverns
### Level 1
Is the "smallest" as it widens up as you descend
	1. The shrooms growing here are highly cultivated and represent most of the edible and nutritious shrooms on the island
	2. The farms are expansive as high tunnels seem to stretch in every direction, The area is not unlike that first level of [[The Endless Pits]] that you traversed weeks ago
		1. The farms here are overgrown, and the shrooms themselves are beginning to overgrow the walls and ceiling on which they grow to close off tunnels completely
	3. [[Dustgore Emberplate]] from the [[The Reinvention]] is the leader in charge on this level (rhino-person, from [[The Crash]])
		1. Generally just drives a plow through a nearby plot of land to feed the living members of the army
		2. Food from this level could likely support [[Rifterra]] for 3 weeks without additional farming...
	4. A single famer - a gnome girl in early 20s named [[Niamh Sporetoes]]  is held as a prisoner in the area by Dustgore, to replant the shrooms he carves up

### Level 2
The mushrooms and fungi get more wild on this level - and it's less tunnels and more a collection of underwater pools
	1. Most fungi are farmed for drugs on this level - with moderate effects/perks
	2. DC16 Perception: it appears that small samples are taken from almost every unique area of this level
		1. Peatmire was searching for the substance that enabled him to commune with his father in the beyond
		2. Periodically, bodies of members from [[The Reinvention]] are scattered, sprawled out. 70% are alive and high out of their minds, 30% are dead of multiple causes
			1. Maybe 30 dead all bearing the brand on the base of their skull
	3. duergar named [[Harj Turnstone]] (Einherjar stats) is the main POC on this level
		1. He's just recently recovered from his trip
		2. 4 others - (githyanki warrior stats) lay nearby and are generally just on patrol
	4. Perception/Survival Check DC25 - one of the pools near the edge of the cavern area here is aquatic tunnel and not a pool 
		1. Fresh natural water bubbles from it, leaving the mushrooms nearby less exotic and more edible/nutritious
		2. Tunnel leads to a long, muddy/marshy underground path heading Eastward. ~8 hours of slow trekking to emerge closer to [[Simulcepio]], but the tunnel continues for 4 more hours to right underneath (the crazy old dude's house in the middle of the pond/lake)
### Level 3
The deep Caverns where the prized mushroom grows
	1. [[The Painted Turtles]] are holed up in here - they've overgrown the passage that leads to the most prized corner of the cavern where the most valued shrooms grow
	2. Myconids are common around here as well - although they're currently staying with the painted turtles
	3. Some "freedom fighters"/protesters from [[Simulcepio]] here too:
		- [[Grainne]] - gnome grandma of [[Aoife]]
		- [[Carth]] (goliath) and [[Barclay]] (dwarf) from [[Hardwood Carvers]] in [[Simulcepio]]
		- [[Aoife]]'s parents were around here and providing shuttle runs, but they were subbing out when things really started intensifying, no major injuries.
	4. [[Jasad Peatmire]] has a camp here as well - surrounded by some of his most trusted men and some undead beserkers who are just constantly slashing at the mushroom barrier.
		1. Bodies of exhausted/scorched undead lie in an ever growing heap - maybe 40 bodies deep
