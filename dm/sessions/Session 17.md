Title: Back to the Doghouse
<hr>

## Recap
Session starts as [[Kailani]] is escaping (while invisible) the Domain of Dogs on a recon mission. She's currently fleeing the Kennels area. Tentative plan is for the party to push back in and finish the large canine off once and for all - before it becomes even more cybernetic than it already is. [[Quzy Akone]], pledged some support from some of his soldiers (KF forgets, hope a PC remembers, otherwise, 4...see below.)
## Fleeing the D.o.D.
Kai needs to succeed on 3 checks in order to succeed and escape back to [[The Lost Change]]'s safe haven. 
They must be different, and unless the party opts to enter into the D.o.D., only the last one can be made with the assistance of the party.
> **DC14** for all to pass.

Success.
Success.
## Room for reinforcements
With [[Quzy Akone]]'s support, the following troops have pledged their support.
1. Tote Slytooth: female Silver kobold inventor https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/kobold-inventor
2. Vrang: male cave goblin https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/cave-goblin
3. Bofur and Tofur Slabstone: dwarven twins https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/dwarf-scout
4. Eustace Todden: tortle https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/tortle
