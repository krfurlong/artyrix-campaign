<hr>
## Big points from last session
- Party wrapped up in [[The Endless Pits]], with [[Quzy Akone]] gifting [[Krystabald]] a chaotic magical item
- Bugsy crit failed his first curse save: Counter is at 3 (out of 24)
	- **Wis save 10 required each time he falls asleep**
- Party met up with [[Privateer Pell Peppercorn]] - a Jerbeen (mouse) pirate whose ship had wrecked.
## Intro Narration
As you all formally welcome [[Privateer Pell Peppercorn]] onboard and grow accustomed to yet another person, you all settle down once more to continue your voyage. The skies are clear this afternoon as you gauge it to be around 2 in the afternoon. Plenty of daylight left to make good progress towards the [[Rusted Keys]] - or elsewhere if that's where winds and the fates may take you. The day is yours...
### Pell's Backstory
- Tried breaking through the siege of [[Havangart]], but her ship sustained significant damage
	- Was affiliated with [[Corsair's Cove]], who were sailing in foodstuffs and interim manufacturing goods
	- Generally unfamiliar who the group surrounding [[Havangart]] was - but they had darker ships, unfamiliar to those she had seen around [[Corsair's Cove]] but if pressed, she may indicate that she's seen at least one similar vessel around [[Port Ruggine]] under the command of a ash grey looking elven figure ([[Osiris Siltguard]]).
- She managed to sail away, but lost some shipmates (hired hands) in the process
- Was getting along pretty fine until her ship was tossed by the wake of a great flying beast _towing_ this very boat in which she is now sailing --> **Perhaps she initiates this as she notices details of the hull/Ship**
	- Essentially lost all control, ship crashed into shallow water reef, drifted for some time until she wound up where she is now
	- She notes that the wood from this vessel is not Khiagian, but rather likely from the forests of [[Machivelia]] - bearing some [[Athenae]] nautical craftsmanship

### Encounter
The party is ambushed at night after picking up Pell. [[Lord Emberfall]] was aware of her spotting him and his ship and feared she may spread word to others
- He hastily mocked up a drawing of her, her ship, and that she spotted him and thus is a target
- That illustration on burlap was given to Emberfall's Kuo-toa followers, widely distributed amongst them

1. 3 kuo-toa whips: https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/kuo-toa-whip
2. 1 abomination from the deep: https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/abomination-from-the-deep

- **Negative**
	- Lightning Weird tears through the sails on a DC15 perception check failure
		- Smells like ozone too
	- Fish/abominations attracted to your vessel - they're slowly beginning to tear into the hull of your ship. If left unfixed, you'll be forced to make some costly repairs upon docking in [[Rusted Keys]].
- **Neutral**
	- A foreman "rhino-person" named [[Capt. Akello]] from [[Linnæsa]] who's aligned with the southern pirates out of [[Charterstown]] is bringing a shipment of destitute but willing pirates to go work in [[Arthur Tennyson]]'s part of the Pits.
		- Bemoaning that they can't just ferry them through [[The Looking Glass]] in [[Rifterra]]
		- Has news on the siege: an unaffiliated small legion of pirates as far as he's concerned
	- A younger triton scholar named [[Iren Moorsend]] (wizard) and aide to one of [[Sagezza]] in the [[Arcanum Decetto]] is completely turned around at sea.
		- Aide to/studying under [[Selene Adonessa]]
		- Seeking to reorient themselves, perhaps get some free supplies
		- Nothing of note to barter/give in return, but willing to put a good word in with the [[Arcanum Decetto]] - and a favor to cash in [[Pythinia]], should [[Iren Moorsend]] return safetly
- **Positive**
	- Friendly merchant vessel - a small schooner led by [[Skipper Caraway]] (typical pirate accent). Hoped to dock in [[Flintpoint Harbor]] in [[Havangart]], but forced to navigate around it due to the siege
		- See his bio for inventory/wares
	- Glint of the sun catches a glint of gold at the bottom of the Azure waters of the [[Eternal Sea]]
		- It's a little shallower here - you may be able to get to whatever is down there...
		- Scattered coins totaling 1d4 x 50gp
			- Somewhat buried in the muck req. a DC17 strength check but also: The Ship's Wheel of the Surefooted - of [[Linnæsa]]n design, if installed at a drydocks, grants a ship +1 to survival/navigational checks
