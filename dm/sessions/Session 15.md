Title: TPK to We-O-Kay!
<hr>

## Recap
- Quickly fought through the fungus gargoyles on Level 1
	- [[Sybil]] was exposed to the spores/mold multiple times - with her reaction to the substance intensifying with each exposure.
	- Nobody else in the party seemed quite as dramatically affected by the mold - outside of some sneezing
- Briefly investigated an abandoned worg and trail of blood leading away from the platform lowering to Level 2 of [[The Endless Pits]]
- Descended without looking into it too closely - proceeded to check out the strange cog and glass filled Level 2 and what [[Quzy Akone]]'s efforts have done
	- After some mild lore drops, the party found themselves in a roulette table guarded my mechanical and ever spawning entities
	- They escaped - though not without some close calls - down the chute and made contact with [[Quzy Akone]], who welcomed them into the base of [[The Lost Change]] and bode them rest through the night
	- [[Quzy Akone]] sure does like flipping that coin of his...[[Krystabald]] was immediately suspicious
- The Party leveled up to **LEVEL 5**

## Waking up to the Lost Change
- Party gets a full rest (and Levels up), with [[Excavator]] waking the group up to bring them towards the "Glass Cathedral" where Quzy is concluding some morning service
	- Entering the crystalline area, you look upon maybe 80 people ranging in race and appearance, although generally they all seem to be slightly poorer
	- Tail end of "sermon"

	> We all were brought here for a reason! We've found a community here together and are working towards something that's bigger than any one of us. And I feel - no, I _know_ that exciting things are coming. (_locks eyes with Kryst/the Party_). We are stronger together - and we can only discover the secrets of the Pits if we delve into it hand-in-hand
	> 
	> **as he says this, one by one people in the pews wordlessly reach out to grab the hand of the person next to them - quietly whispering "hand in hand" a few times, almost as if echoing Quzy's last words.**

### (Partial) Tour through Level 2
- Feature the glassblowers cabin - the molten glass pool that feeds their work
	- Note that we don't typically go much beyond the cabin, more dangerous with creatures that spawn from these very walls of the Pits
		- Glass forest is serpent-ridden, a path cuts through it to the crystalline staircase and elevator* that descends deeper
	- A strange amalgomation of cogs and gears; things grow weirder if you press onward, almost seems like things get fuzzy and warped

#### The way down
- There's a glass staircase beyond the glass forest that can be traversed to descend to Level 3
- There's an ethereal glass elevator immediately next to it - though it can only be "activated" if the Ethereal Lens is retrieved from the [[Vault of Bones]], deep within the Domain of the Dogs ([[In the Doghouse]])

### Glassblower
