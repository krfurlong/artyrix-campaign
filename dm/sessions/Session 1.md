## A Soppy Start

Something...mysterious and thematic?
>The Eternal Sea. An enormous body of water that drives apart people, separates distinct cultures, and forces individuals to think for themselves. And yet, the ocean is also a great unifier: all who brave it face the same dangers. It connects everyone - despite these perils - and allows people, ideas, and culture to be shared around the world. There is something...striking about these waters. There is power in what is hidden deep in the watery abyss below. There is wisdom in knowing when to surge forward into the unknown; and knowing when to call the search off full-stop. There are stories to be told upon these waters, _concerning_ these waters, and about those who become the source of legend who travel upon it. 
>
>It is one such story - or rather, a fantastic tapestry of stories - that we begin to explore today - As five individuals with fates not yet intertwined, all find themselves upon the deep azure waters of the Eternal Sea.
>
>Pale morning light greets you all this day, as the sun cuts through overcast skies on what would be an otherwise perfect day for sailing. The crisp salty air of the [[Eternal Sea]] overwhelms your senses but for a moment, before its familiarity registers once more as fades into the background. Each in your own way, on your own vessels arise - stepping out onto the upper deck to meet the day.

#### Sybil and Krystabald
- Sailing on a smaller merchant vessel headed from [[Machivelia]] to [[Havangart]].
	- Named: The Deft Quartz
	- Captain: [[Ralph Midcliff]] (dwarf); First Mate: [[Penn Bickerknocker]] (gnome)
- Penn to the 2 of them: _"Awfully beautiful day, ain't it! Shame we should be only on the seas for part of the day. Expect we'll be making landfall in [[Rifterra]] by nightfall if these smooth conditions hold up!"_
	- What do you expect you folks will do once you're there? Not every day folks like...er...yourselves...seem keen to go to and stay in [[Havangart]] for any sort of time period...?
#### Aoife
- Sailing with pirates around the [[Khiage]] region
	- Ship Name: The Jolly Rogue
	- Captain: [[Garvin]] (giff; deep/"swallowed"/dark but hearty/bouncy voice) - peg leg? First Mate: [[Finny O'Malley]] (halfling)
- Garvin greets Aoife upon seeing her:
	- Aye - look it's our local virtuoso! Slept in a bit longer than usual - don't ya think Aoife? Careful that you're not making a habit of it, lest I think yerr sleeping to skirt of your chores. Hate to rescind some of the wages we promised yer because yer weren't waking up at the crow's call..
		- Aoife, what's the long term plan here? Yer tell great stories and bring the morale of the crew up whenever you're aboard, but more and more yer seem lost in thought and spend the near entire trip gazing off to the horizon. What are yer searching for?

#### Bugsy
- Sailing on a transport vessel - perhaps 30-40 other passengers. Magically propelled vessel; Tight quarters
	- Ship Name: _Caravan of the Seas_
	- Captain: [[Zatara Goldthorn]] (Half elf female; sun-kissed golden skin; fair blonde hair; Member of [[The Ascendent]]); First Mate: Pugh Grunk (full orc)
- Fellow traveler - a hobogoblin...potentially notices and recognizes Bugsy
	- Where you headed, heregon? What's your business in Khiage?
	- ...say, you wouldn't happen to have spent much time in [[New Sigil]]? You a formal member in any of the Parties?
		-  Give much thought to the upcoming election?
	- I had some family tied in with [[The Kismet]] expressed some frustration over the...repressive institutions there? (Brother currently locked up in main jail there)

#### Kailani


## Into the Fray
#combat

- 2 Corpse Candles - reskinned as "Orange moss creatures"; 30 HP, no physical damage resistance; in the water

	- https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/kuo-toa-whip
- 1 Kuo-Toa Monitor, on land + Corrupting Smite
	- https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/kuo-toa-monitor
	- **_Corrupting Smite._** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with necrotic fever. The cursed target can’t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 7 (2d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.
