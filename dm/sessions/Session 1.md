Title: **A Soppy Start**
<hr>
## A Soppy Start

>The Eternal Sea. An enormous body of water that drives apart people, separates distinct cultures, and forces individuals to think for themselves. And yet, the ocean is also a great unifier: all who brave it face the same dangers. It connects everyone - despite these perils - and allows people, ideas, and culture to be shared around the world. There is something...striking about these waters. There is power in what is hidden deep in the watery abyss below. There is wisdom in knowing when to surge forward into the unknown; and knowing when to call the search off full-stop. There are stories to be told upon these waters, _concerning_ these waters, and about those who become the source of legend who travel upon it. 
>
>It is one such story - or rather, a fantastic tapestry of stories - that we begin to explore today - As five individuals with fates not yet intertwined, all find themselves upon the deep azure waters of the Eternal Sea.
>
>Pale morning light greets you all this day, as the sun cuts through overcast skies on what would be an otherwise perfect day for sailing. The crisp salty air of the [[Eternal Sea]] overwhelms your senses but for a moment, before its familiarity registers once more as fades into the background. Each in your own way, on your own vessels arise - stepping out onto the upper deck to meet the day.

**As each player has their vignette, they get the opportunity to (re)introduce their PC.**

#### Sybil and Krystabald
- Sailing on a smaller merchant vessel headed from [[Machivelia]] to [[Havangart]].
	- Named: The Deft Quartz
	- Captain: [[Ralph Midcliff]] (dwarf); First Mate: [[Penn Bickerknocker]] (gnome)
- Penn to the 2 of them: _"Awfully beautiful day, ain't it! Shame we should be only on the seas for part of the day. Expect we'll be making landfall in [[Rifterra]] by nightfall if these smooth conditions hold up!"_
	- What do you expect you folks will do once you're there? Not every day folks like...er...yourselves...seem keen to go to and stay in [[Havangart]] for any sort of time period...?
#### Aoife
- Sailing with pirates around the [[Khiage]] region
	- Ship Name: The Jolly Rogue
	- Captain: [[Garvin]] (giff; deep/"swallowed"/dark but hearty/bouncy voice) - peg leg. 
		- First Mate: [[Finny O'Malley]] (halfling)
- Garvin greets Aoife upon seeing her:
	- Aye - look it's our local virtuoso! Slept in a bit longer than usual - don't ya think Aoife? Careful that you're not making a habit of it, lest I think yerr sleeping to skirt of your chores. Hate to rescind some of the wages we promised yer because yer weren't waking up at the crow's call..
		- Aoife, what's the long term plan here? Yer tell great stories and bring the morale of the crew up whenever you're aboard, but more and more yer seem lost in thought and spend the near entire trip gazing off to the horizon. What are yer searching for?

#### Bugsy
- Sailing on a transport vessel - perhaps 30-40 other passengers. Magically propelled vessel; Tight quarters
	- Ship Name: _Caravan of the Seas_
	- Captain: [[Zatara Goldthorn]] (Half elf female; sun-kissed golden skin; fair blonde hair; Member of [[The Ascendent]]); First Mate: Pugh Grunk (full orc)
- Fellow traveler - a hobogoblin [[Horkis Sentrixson]]...potentially notices and recognizes Bugsy
	- Where you headed, heregon? What's your business in Khiage?
	- ...say, you wouldn't happen to have spent much time in [[New Sigil]]? You a formal member in any of the Parties?
		-  Give much thought to the upcoming election?
	- I had some family tied in with [[The Kismet]] expressed some frustration over the...repressive institutions there? (Brother currently locked up in main jail there: [[Dimensional Penitentiary]])

#### Kailani
- Sailing as a discovered stowaway - largely a commercial trading vessel. En route
	- Ship Name: _The Misty Moon_
	- Captain: [[Charles Dewey]]; 
	- first mate: Sigmund Skimmer (goes by Siggy; esotericly smart)
- Dewey calls Kailani into the captain's quarters at some point:
	> Listen, Kai - I know we started off on...awkward footing, but you know, since then, I've been decently happy with your work onboard. You seem to have a natural familiarity with the sea, something that not many folk learn even after years on these strange waters...
	> Anyway, I just wanted to apologize for my tone earlier - you've got to understand that I can't be fostering a reputation of harboring stowaways. The crew are...well, some are loyal folk, but most of the lot are hired hands from [[Khiage]]. I trust them about as far as I can throw them...You're still on the hook for payment of the voyage, and I gotta enforce a fee on top of the usual fare - I hope you understand. If the crew sense that I'm not being fair or looking after the whole ship's interest, they'll mutiny faster than you can say _"By Azuth's Wand"_
	
## A Unifying Storm

> While the morning of your voyages proceeds without issue, you all note on your respective vessels the sky growing grey as the morning transitions to early afternoon. No sooner had you all noticed this mildly concerning but not so dangerous shift in the weather, than the winds around you flare up in intensity while their direction shifts from a predictable course to more much more sporadic.
>  
> Garvin yells out to the navigator at the helm: "Take care of the ship laddy - and watch those incoming vessels, we don't want to be running abreast of them in even the fairest of tides!" as he draws you attention (Aiofe) to three other ships who had drawn closer and were similarly stuck in whatever weather system had just sprung up.

> Kailani - you see Dewey rush out of his quarters, assisting the crew in tying down the masts that had immediately become ineffective from the frenetic winds. He issues a similar order Siggy on the helm to stay the course, but avoid nearing the ships growing nearer - though you hear (Kailani) him mutter under his breath - *Especially those that are flying under those colors...bloody corsairs*

> The storm continues to build in intensity, much to the despair of all those onboard your ships -as your respective trajectories just so happen to draw your ships  closer and closer to one another, as the tides and waves themselves seem to be exerting their own will to drive the ships together against the best hopes and intensions of the helmspeople. 

As the chaos of the storm continues wrecking havoc - You all notice a slight rumbling reverberate through the air - as to your horror, a large an island unexpectedly bursts from the sea: immediately in the path of your ships. In doing so, a large wave forms and begins pulsing outward from the massive displacement from the newly airborn island. 
> 
Sybil/Krystabald you hear a panicked voice of [[Penn Bickerknocker]] cry out "CAPTAIN! Uh ah i'm not sure where it came from but we're headed straight towards land - it just sprung outta nowhere!

"Response: Turn us about, hard to the starboard side!" 

as you all feel your ships lurch from beneath you, the wave impacts your sides and a sharp gust of wind knocks you both from you grounding: throwing you all suddenly overboard.



## Into the Fray
#combat

- 2 Corpse Candles - reskinned as "Orange moss creatures"; 30 HP, no physical damage resistance; in the water
	- https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/corpse-candle
- 2 Kuo-Toa Whips - one on land; one in sea
	- https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/kuo-toa-whip
- 1 Kuo-Toa Monitor, on land + Corrupting Smite
	- https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/kuo-toa-monitor
	- **_Corrupting Smite._** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with necrotic fever. The cursed target can’t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 7 (2d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.

## Exploring Pontecita

> Premise: _[[Lord Emberfall]] fled from his estate on [[Machivelia]] in search of a place where he could teleport freely away from Artyrix. He's in search of a greater power - seeking it in [[Jolastokia]]. [[Pontecita]] was selected by him on the advice of various Kuo-Toas that he had been amassing under his religious mantle since it seemed to be arising from the [[Eternal Sea]], and was relatively remote from [[The Northern Barrier Islands]]. As such, he inscribed a teleportation circle on the island - leaving all those who followed him there behind, without care._ 

> Safest path through the island to follow the tracks of \insert NPC of interest\ is: **25, 22, 18, 13, 14, 20**.

1. Western beach - discarded logs and planks lay about, washed ashore from the recent storm. Higher likelihood of flagging down someone from [[Khiage]].
2. Western beach - buried treasure here, potentially poking out of the sand with a high enough INV check.
3.  SW beach - dangerous, large sand crabs reside here though.
4. SW beach - higher likelihood of flagging down someone from [[Corosiva]]
5. NW beach - dangers of quicksand amid the sandy, rat infested beach
6. beach/jungle - buried in a shallow grave with strange abyssal glyphs around, a [mummy](https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/mummy-of-the-deep)  might be found - along with 25gp and a small sapphire worth 15gp.
7. Jungle - Thick vines require significant effort to carve through: Con save DC13 or 1pt exhaustion
8. Jungle - Displacer beast family (1 normal + 2 at half HP, 1 attack each)
9. Marshy/swamp - a wide variety of odd looking mushrooms grow here. Many are completely harmless and can sustain an individual for a day (DC13 Inv check to find); DC14 Surv check to discern whether they're poisonous or not
	- Also, quicksand?
10. Beach - lots of seaweed blown in from the storm, overturned trees. [Corpse candle](https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/corpse-candle) floats just on the waters edge as if to lure people in.
11. A hidden grotto between the jungle and mountains feat. a legit mermaid [[Caspianna]] who's trapped in this small lake. No immediately viable way to get her out - perhaps through the river though?
12. Caves nestled among higher peaks and jungle area: an offshoot group of Kuo-Toas followers, who are actively worshiping the medusa in #17 after seeing it turn one of their own into stone.
13. Jungle: giant bees live amongst the trees. Could be circumvented by crossing into another space; or snuck past; or dealt with to collect on their honey; 
	    [Hive Queen](https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/hive-queen) lives within a burrow/hive, will defend itself if disturbed. Otherwise, just 3 Giant Wasps (NEB) attack
14. Traversing the more mountainous terrain here requires a Con Save DC11 or 1pt of exhaustion; At the end of the trail, a large cave/tunnel meets the group with a camp visibly set up inside 
    Koa-Toa _Archpriest_ + 2 normal kuo-toas. **Very dangerous encounter.** Archpriest Yumagluglug willing to converse with party, investigate the inner chamber. They're afraid of going in because they saw an intense arcane flash and don't want to upset their presumed god.
    There are some 
15. Southern beach - forested leading to a decent (120ft) sheer cliff. Higher likelihood to flag down [[Havangart]] bound vessels. High density of vines here indicates maybe building a raft here would be more likely...
	    Potential combat: Assassin vine + 2 vine vipers.
	    Emberfall's boat hidden among the trees here
16. The stream here flows clear and could be a source of drinking water. Small beasts also attracted to this area of rolling hills. Potentially flag down a [[Khiage]] - [[Machivelia]] vessel.
17. **Medusa lair** - strange jungle terrain ground shift suddenly from dirt to small pieces of stone. Rumors/notes around the entrance to a dark cave seem to imply that a good bit of wealth may be held within...Maybe just a map to the treasure hidden in #2
18. Dirt path leading to an Intersection - paths to #17, #13, #22, and #19 next to the bank of a small stream.
	    **Plot point**: Discarded satchel of papers, grouped into roughly 3 bundles:
	    1st - documents from chartering a ship out of [[Pythinia]] under the name: [[Duke Nautilus Starport]] ship name: The Blue Wave 
	    2nd - ledger (falsified) from [[Havangart]], amended to pick up/purchase arcane components including pulverized gemstones, high quality chalks, and rare mushrooms useful in projection
	    3rd - pages ripped out of a tome: **[[Artyrian Mysticism]]**. From the [[Arcanum Decetto]], the pages give context and speculate on the power of the Kuo-Toa, remarking on their belief in strange gods and hypothesized power of instilling others with divine gifts. 
19. Dunes/plains: adamantine worm territory...
20. Emberfall's workshop - nestled underneath a small, semi-dormant volcano -- see below
21. Overturned rowboat on the beach - likely from a storm weeks ago. 3 skeletons tumble out
22. Dirt path leading to an Intersection - paths to #25, #18, #23, and #21.
	    **Plot point**: signs of a scuffle (between fellow kuo-toas) as they had a hard time reading and understanding the directions. Survival check DC14 to figure this out, higher may yield a blood trail to...
	    One Kuo-toa (Perchiswelligut) got injured and is leaned up against a tree a bit off the path. Potentially tries to inform where the rest of their group all went (2 to north, 2 to south, 5 to west)
23. Significant sand dunes - Climbing over them repeated DC13 Con Save or 1pt of exhaustion, but potentially easier to flag down a ship towards [[Machivelia]]
24. A large moss-covered home, where a Lake Troll - named Teg - lives amid the foothills of the large caves and other moss covered rocks. Not immediately hostile, mostly just wants to be left alone - and for someone to help him retrieve his meat cleaver than fell down a large crevasse that he's too large to go down.
25. The starting beach and the scene of the initial Kuo-Toa led combat. Also the site of [[Taruk's Tiny Tiki Taverna]].

### Environmental Hazards
If the party opts to rest (long or short), one of the following occurs:

| roll | outcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Supernatural Storms:** Unpredictable weather patterns bring forth violent tempests capable of toppling trees and flooding lowlands. Navigating through such hazards requires survival skills, magical assistance, or divine intervention. Electrical storms can carry additional threats like lightning strikes.                   |
| 2    | **Creepy but harmless plants**: Vines with small yellow flowers slowly begin covering the party members, leaving them restrained if unimpeded. The vines are harmless, just curious - unless they are attacked in which case they turn violent (see assassin vine stats). They can be moved by taking an action to remove the vines. |
| 3    | **Acidic mists**: The fog in the immediate proximity picked up spores from the nearby fungi of this island leaving the fog with caustic properties. Con save DC13 or take some damage.                                                                                                                                               |
| 4    | **Diseased Land**: The land on which you are resting begins taking on a darker character and you all sink ever so slightly deeper. It may have the power to corrupt even the most wholesome of people -- wisdom save DC12 or be "diseased" for the next 8 hours.                                                                     |
| 5-6  | **Volcanic Activity 1:** The dormant volcano begins turning active. Tremors deep within the earth and black smoke active volcano on the island suddenly erupts. Visibility is obscured                                                                                                                                               |
| 5-6  | **Volcanic Activity 2:** An active volcano on the island suddenly erupts, causing lava to begin to flow. This natural disaster can create dangerous terrain, force rerouting, or attract monstrous creatures seeking warmth and food.                                                                                                |
