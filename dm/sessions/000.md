## An Intro to Artyrix
- Quick overview of the campaign setting
	- Lots of islands! Action, plots, mysteries are common across each and every one of them
		- Off-shoot almost entirely separate civilization from Jolastokia; though if you're interested in some cross-over, let me know and pitch your case
	- Magic items are _struggling_. 
		- Alchemy is filling the void here - lots more potions, and generally expendable items
		- Ex. also spell scrolls
		- Arcana-technology/magic-tech also surging and far more common across many of the islands
	- Strong similarities to ancient Greek mythology where the distinction between man and the divine is sometimes blurred, or even goes back-and-forth
	- 
- High level goal of sandbox campaign 
	- More than Jolastokia, I'd really love for this campaign to be more sandbox-y
		- Have an idea/theme for a city or town; or a political regime; or a faction? Let me know! Let's make it happen!
		- I'm really interested in the collaborative story-telling aspect to see what we can all do here
