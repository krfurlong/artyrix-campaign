_Session recap_...

Night-watches:
1. Owlin woo's but other than that - nothing out of the ordinary
2. Man going for a walk with his "dog" (a scout for Tennyson); Gearforged Templar stat, hooded - blue/purple cloak, with clockwork hound
3. Note delivered via hound saying:

> Your actions have consequences that stretch beyond that which you consider. This your first and final warning: take heed in those with whom you ally. They will not protect you - like servants running errands, you are nothing to them. But nonetheless, you've caught our attention - and we are watching - [[The Geotic Unium]]

Next day intro:
> Well rested once more aboard your sloop - despite the periodic hooting of the owlin on the nearby [[Brazen Barnacle]], you all arise to meet the day. The weather, comparatively more dreary on this day, as the skies above you take on a slightly darker hue as rain seems to be on the horizon. Already, a slightly cool wind whips around your hair, tossing it in chaotic patterns. Around you all, the harbor is alive with activity as inbound vessels quickly replace the hastily leaving outgoing traders and merchants, each group hoping to beat the oncoming storm - unsure of how intense it may be. As these comings and goings quickly pass by around you, the still-dry day is yours - what adventures will it bring?
