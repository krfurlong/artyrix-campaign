Title: Breaking the Siege
<hr>
## Recap
- Bugsy curse save: Counter is at **5 (out of 24)**
	- **Wis save 10 required each time he falls asleep**
- Party bartered off their rations to a swarm of crabs
	- Managed to befriend the crabstrocity...
- Met [[Skipper Art Caraway]] - talked a bit, learned some more about the siege
- Interacted with Umi, the silver pseudodragon from [[Nymphsong]]
- Kai had a vision of sharks - opted to not choose, unclear what the consequences of this are...
## Intro
It is nearly a moonless night this evening - as Dat Aft, buffered by the accompanying ships in the small armada, drift nearly silently through the narrow strait. The once dangerously electrically charged - the deep thrum of the electric current and smell of ozone has waned since you even first arrived at this atoll on the [[Eternal Sea]] - spelling out safety for your fleet and danger for those foes that lay beyond the buffer between you and the island of [[Havangart]].

## The party's plan
- Aiming for:
	- Crabs as a first wave/distraction
	- Strategically sailing through
