Title: *?*
<hr>

> You all sleep restfully - as you are gently rocked to sleep by the calm ebbs and flows of the Eternal Sea and notably out of immediate danger for the first time since finding one another. An errant bell and sporadic seagull's squak jerk a few of you awake from time to time throughout the night, but for the most part, you all arise naturally - to the unmistakable iridescence of the sun's rays glinting off of the water and casting a prismatic spray of colors across your face, as morning breaks and Port Ruggine gradually begins to liven up.
> 
> (who's awake first?)
> 
> As you arise from your deep slumber, you notice an auburn colored fox-like humanoid - a Vulpin ([[Kikai]]), intently watching your ship - or sloop - whilst absent mindedly whittling a piece of wood, now down to a mere splinter as you clock the small pile of wood-shaving at their feet. Upon seeing you arise, they kick off the dock post they were leaning against and casually saunter towards your vessel.
## Recouping Costs - and Connecting Buyers
- Kikai leads a small but more elite scavenger ship called the [[Brazen Barnacle]]
- You did recall seeing them when you were finishing off [[Miranda Barnibas]] and [[Eilif Talbjorne]]
- Bela spoke with the corpse of Miranda and Eilif a la speak with dead. They learned the following:
	- They were contracted to get scales - but also nagged the eggs when the opportunity presented itself.
		- The buyer is secret to most - this is their leverage point. It's [[General Lutskyiv]]. 
		- Without the right buyer, most merchants in [[Faciv]] either don't know their true value or couldn't compensate properly - Would offer closer to 1000gp per scale instead of the 2500gp.
	- They learned the origins of your group - eg got picked up in the middle of the Sea and were largely on good terms with you all until you hopped ship and abandoned your duties.
		- Seemed pretty keen on getting revenge for what you all did, but no need to worry with them being dead and all now.
- They also found the corpse of [[Vex Sparksong]] smashed into the rock face. It was harder to understand her because of the glass that lacerated her face but they took away
	- Your group seemed largely uninteresting except for the gifted tinkerer that seemed to give even Vex a run for her money in terms of inventive spirit - seemed insistent on she get credit/patent for the pod-projectors.
	- (Also, hiding that Vex shared news of the bounty on [[Sybil]]. No further details apart from the sum (10k)) - [[A Lion's Share]]

## Dock Fees
[[Port Ruggine]] is relatively small considering it is the primary port of [[Corosiva]]. It is very well-protected.

Fees here run higher because of this:
- 5gp a day - or 50gp for a fortnight.

 Steward [[Rast Brecchiason]] comes by shortly after their discussion with [[Kikai]] to discuss this matter.
## Lingering Quests
- Selling dragon scales
- Recapturing the prized elks
- Delivering some missives to around [[Delver]]
	- [[A Courtly Summoning]]
- Exploring [[The Endless Pits]]?
