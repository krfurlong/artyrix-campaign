Title: 
<hr>
## Recap
- Bugsy curse save: Counter is at **6 (out of 24)**
	- **Wis save 11 required each time he falls asleep**
- Party attempted to fight their way through/into [[The Fermenti Caverns]]
- Eventually surrendered and forced to agree to assist [[The Reinvention]] in procuring the [[Quyllurkuna Agaricus]] ([[Siege on the High Seas]])
- Met up with [[Don Don]] who was also captured 

## Intro
Dim light shed by periodic torches pitched throughout this tunnel cast eerie shadows in the otherwise drab cavernous space. A large pyre of bodies burn slowly, filling the space with a smell that would have made you gag had you been alone. 6 large, undead-like figures hulk around, towing immobile bodies away from a wall of iridescent fungi and towards the pyre. 

As your eyes adjust to the inconsistent flickering, the figure before you turns to face you. Both young and ancient, the figure has smooth ashen grey skin, and disheveled hair primarily black in color but with streaks of gray that perhaps betray his true age. While he stands boldly before you, his eyes are pale - distant - as if they've already seen a lifetime of sights and yet are still pressed to peer ever onward. Dressed in dark leathers, he wields a long black handled and red-tinged bladed scythe confidently in his hands, twirling it quickly before stowing it behind his back as your party approaches.
## Meeting [[Jasad Peatmire]]
> Finally, you all are here. I am tired of throwing myself, my brothers, and sisters at this fungi mess. You shall serve as emissaries between us and the druids within. You will fetch me the Quyulurkuna and in exchange, we shall leave this island without another word. And I shall permit you lot to walk away from here alive. 
> That would seem quite fair to me –  my accomplices have already extended their grace and forgiveness in sparing your lives, so this would appear in fact to render you even more in our debt…
> [[Tau-0]], thank you for escorting them. You may take your leave to the levels above. I believe [[Harj Turntbjorne]] could use support in finding interim resting places for our brothers whose bodies were wrecked by the effects of the more caustic mushrooms from these past weeks.  

Some things observed by Jasad re: the fortifications of [[The Painted Turtles]]:
- It resists all magical efforts and lashes out terribly for those who attempt to press against it
- I doubt the intentions of the druids within – they hold life dear but they fear our movement and truths more: I worry they would destroy the [[Quyllurkuna Agaricus]] in front of me before permitting us to force our way in and take it
- Before you push onward – who among you will serve as my point of connection? (Decaying Telepathy, DC18 INT save to be “infected”)  (❗)
- Would offer to brand anyone to make their connection to [[The Reinvention]] permanent...
### [[The Reinvention]] Brand mechanics
- You can use a bonus action to enable/disable your connection to The Beyond, or the web of others bearing the brand. 
	- When you are connected, you have disadvantage on all charm/charisma checks vs. superiors in the cult
		- Immediately fail on any Dominate person spells cast against you
	- While connected, you can freely communicate mentally with all other connected creatures within 60 feet
		- This includes all **undead**, branded creatures
- You may cast the following spells:
	- Chill Touch (cantrip)
	- Cause Fear (1/day)
	- Whither & Bloom (1/day)
	- Sending (1/day) to anyone else branded


## Entrance to [[The Painted Turtles]] Layer
Carved above the passageway leading into the deepest level of the Fermenti caverns are the words:

> “Beyond here lies the Sewer Lair – Only turtles and those who have earned their trust are welcome.
> Step wisely and trust your totally tubular thoughts to take you through the threshold.
> All others beware and be gone.”

> [[The Turnstone Sigil]] - name for [[Kailani]]'s village's stone...

**Start side**
### Clearing the Riddle Wall
Emerging to the other side, you find yourselves in almost complete darkness save a single torch burning roughly 30 feet away from you, casting dim light across the inner-cavern.

Three druidic looking Tortles (orange, purple, and blue sashes) are clustered closely around the flame, seemingly staring straight through it (and you all for that matter) as they focus on the dense wall of noxious mushrooms from which you all just emerged. Mid-chant, they don't even seem to acknowledge your presence save a quick look of near panic by the nearest tortle wearing a royal blue sash around their waist.

Instead of one of these leaders, a ragged but intently focused pinkish-purple myconid figure steps forward to meet you all (Spombu), nasally voice.

- Uh…Halt. Who are you? Your faces are unfamiliar and until the Painted Turtles have finished their incantation, I must insist that you remain where you are.
- Potential combat: [https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/myconid-alchemist-iv](https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/myconid-alchemist-iv) (Spombu), 2-4 spore servants, and 1 [https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/mi-go](https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/mi-go)

- Only if things grow dire. 4 rounds of combat and then the Tortles reawaken.

## In the Realm of [[The Painted Turtles]]
Snippet from [[Siege on the High Seas]].
> [[The Painted Turtles]] oversee the caverns, but do not believe the fungus within the caves belong to any one person or group. They defend this belief ardently, despite being relatively non-confrontational and pacificists in their own right: Many think the land and its resources are worth sacrificing for. They've drawn support from the locals of [[Havangart]], especially [[Simulcepio]] who share their concerns and some in [[Rifterra]] who are not as economically driven.

Regions in [[The Fermenti Caverns]]:
- Tortle Lair: inner-most sanctum and greenhouse area
- The Deep Gardens - locale for the most prized and rare mushrooms
	- [[Quyllurkuna Agaricus]] - mimics the Astral Projection spell
	- [[Obscuris Draconomus]] - mimics the Illusory Dragon spell
	- [[Astras Iluminatoria]] - Crown of Stars spell
- The Mycillian Ward - deep pit stretching who knows how far
	- Slight pulsing blue light deep down there - only mychonids are welcome there though
	- Tortles respect their privacy
	- Other than Spombu who's more tortle-aligned some key NPCs include:
		- [[Ostra]] - a grey colored frilly mushroom matriarchal figure. Supportive of tortles but weary of outsiders
		- [[Lanternis]] - bright orange and more assertive, verging on aggressive mushroom figure.
			- Critical of efforts spent keeping [[Jasad Peatmire]] out - claims to have been contacted by [[The Reinvention]] leader and assured they would leave upon getting what they need
			- Unbeknownst to others: Lanternis has supplied seed mushrooms to the aid and benefit of [[The Reinvention]] to facilitate some of these talks and discussions.
			- Generally is seeking the tortles gone from [[The Fermenti Caverns]] - or at least a flipped power structure with him on top and the tortles submitting themselves to become Spore Servants of the Colony
- The Visitors Hovel
	- [[Grainne]] - gnome grandma of [[Aoife]]
	- [[Carth]] (goliath) and [[Barclay]] (dwarf) from [[Hardwood Carvers]] in [[Simulcepio]]
	- Maybe 10 others hailing from [[Simulcepio]], but none that [[Aoife]] recognizes
### Reintroducing [[Grainne]]
As you are led through the area, you quickly bump into a short line of figures  - maybe 8 long and ranging in race, stature, and age. Looking around the line as it twists around a corner and into a noticeably mushroom-less cave in the larger caverns, you all see an elderly gnomish woman - likely deep into her most senior years with wrinkles and laugher lines so deep you can't see the end of them. With eyes just barely peeping open still, her entire face seems dominated by the beaming, slightly slack-jawed grin plastered across her face as you hear her warble out loudly: "All right you freedom fighters! Get in line - soup's ready!" With this, two figures - a dwarf and goliath - waddle forward from deeper in the cave carrying a large soup-pot between them. With a shared glance and smile between them, and then a similar look of happiness and admiration towards the gnome matriarch, the trio of figures whipped out ladles from seemingly nowhere and begun whipping out piping hot bowls of thick soup (potato-vegetable).

Grainne knows:
- [[Simulcepio]] generally supportive of [[The Painted Turtles]] and has been delivering food since news of the Siege broke
	- Didn't realize the Turtles were the "reason" for the siege until much more recently
	- That's steeled their resolve of the town though
	- [[Lord Maris]] organized a collection/food drive and has been coordinating volunteers ever since (few weeks?) - of course with [[Patsy]]'s help!
- [[Aoife]]'s parents both big supporters - were actually subbing out just recently when things really got intense, hence Grainne got sort of stuck here
- Probably enough food around here to last a few days - potentially longer if the tortles can break away from focusing on defending the entrance and support food conjuration
- Getting in and out? 
	- "oh well it was a lot easier before they really closed us in here. You know that sort of batty older gentleman who lives all by his lonesome on that island outside of town? Turns out he's a big proponent of self-medication and herbal remedies and has been doing his own experimenting for decades. He built his home where he did because it's sitting right atop a long vent that cuts pretty much straight to these Caverns. Nobody knew about it until people started really talking about logistics but somehow he heard about it and was quick if a little wary to open his small island up for the cause."

## Escaping [[The Fermenti Caverns]] via the Tunnel Path

Skill challenge if the party is detected. Some things going on to prompt:
1. Emerging from the walls are literal zombies as the walls begin to dampen and then turn to mud, undead begin pulling themselves down into the tunnel and start intervening in your path
2. You begin hear and series of loud metallic thomps and periodic zaps as [[Tau-0]] is seen running after you all and gaining
3. (whoever is impacted by the connection to [[Jasad Peatmire]]), DC18 Int save or get thrown into the wall (4d6 bludgeoning damage)
4. Walls begin getting caved in DC16 str/dex save or 4d6
5. Sleep fungi bombs begin getting thrown
6. A panther druid ([[[Vernix Dendronicus]]]) in hot pursuit attempts to polymorph whoever is running the slowest to capture them and return them to [[The Reinvention]]
