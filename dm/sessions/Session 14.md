## Recap
Party in about to do quick combat at cave location (F).

### When Fungi attack
- 2 Fungus gargoyles
- 1 gas spores (residue from prior destroyed aberrant fungi)
	- **[[Sybil]] makes this check with disadvantage** due to an allergy unbeknownst to her...until now
		- On a failure, she falls prone, losing complete faculty of her legs
	- Common allergy among the nobility of [[Dynistia]], known on a DC20 Survival check 

A large patch of...the wall nearby the combat looks artificially carved out, as if excavated. Around the borders of the wall there's evidence of this Aberrant fungi (_peligranis adynistica_); INV check to surmise that someone was likely harvesting it

Higher check or magic, figures that harvested likely departed already; Potentially carry with them some form of undead energy/magic (necrotic blackness near extremities?)

### Level 1 exploration of [[The Endless Pits]]
> 200 ft down

E. Spider den/harvested daily by the Scrapborn
G. Sign post pointing to fungus farms, water fall, and "outer loop." 
H. A wounded moss druid, firbolg named [[Kody]], encountered the people harvesting the moss and tried to intercede. Looks after the Treant in I.
I. 1 weeping treant rests wounded, but still guards the retaining wall of the Pits; destroying it will result in more water flowing in - potentially flooding the lower most levels
J. a single worg, tied up to a post with footprints leading to K
K. moss-covered mechanical elevator down to level 2; eerily vacant of anyone, but a bloody trail leads of f towards **N**
L. Somewhat less disturbed area, thick covered with moss; Investigating DC16 reveals some traps/untriggered magical gems (2nd level thunderwave if broken) or a chain lightning (3 creatures, 3d6 each within 20 feet of one another)
M. mossy "beach" of sorts; spores washed up that indicate a potential charm effect in **P**
N. a Vine troll Skeleton rests unmoving at the intersection, currently digesting a half-elf wearing the colors of the [[The Scrapborn]]
O. Water turbine, operated by [[Tootsnub Wrinkletocker]], an enterprising gnome; cautious/wary of outsiders and has largely boobytrapped his entire homestead
P. flooded cavern - requires submerged swimming; DC13 charisma save when nearing an 
Q.  Domain of Princess Porcini, the fungal fae (pixie) "kingdom"
R. Domain of Princess Porcini, the fungal fae (pixie) "kingdom"
S. Mirror junction, connecting to [[Tootsnub Wrinkletocker]]
T. Fringe camp of some outsiders, followers of [[Quzy Akone]].
U. A small shrine, built to Quzy
V. a series of small terraced farms 

### Level 2 of [[The Endless Pits]]

> Descending a layer, the moss covered walls give way to glass and clean crystalline walls, grandfather-clock esque.

A. Sign post and general map of the northern section
B. 
#### Base of [[The Lost Change]]
- [[Quzy Akone]]'s "base" of Ops is hidden on level 2 (make a map)
- Combat/entrance to the base: Roulette themed?
> 	The wheel alternates Red then Black - on and on until the end of time. And yet the House maintains that the only true way to cash out is by going through its own special, designated channels.
	(e.g., enter the wheel and stay on green)
	
- Layer actions (each entity can be "bought off" for 10 of the coin of the corresponding color)
	- 3 bronze scout (lightning damage; recharge 6) spawn
	- 2 silver scouts (cold damage; recharge 5-6)
	- 1 gold scout: https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/clockwork-myrmidon
- The roulette machine is a https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/gearkeeper-construct
	- Only attacks if someone tries to approach the wheel/not on Green
