<hr>

## Recap
- Party had a real heart to heart with [[Quzy Akone]] about his objectives and the goings on in [[The Endless Pits]]
- In search of the Ethereal Lens, the party delved into the Domain of Dogs on Level 2
	- Nearly perished outside of the [[Vault of Bones]], but managed to (barely) escape with their lives automaton dogs swarmed the downed body of the "pack lord" cyborg dog
- Passed underneath the Cog Crusher Gate to escape into Sands of Time
	- Exhausted - they bedded down for the night

## Passing through the Sands
Watches
1st: loud crunches and crashes of a series of mechanical dog who apparently tried to follow you out.
	DC 15 Perception: a group of dogs on the opposite side of the Cog-Crusher are pulling a bloodied/mangled creature behind them. They seem to be deferential to it and it eventually calls them off with a rabid sounding series of gutteral yaps
2nd: Flash of light towards the left-most edge of the expansive cavern
	DC 15 Perception: see a series of mechanical, coglike entities swarming around moving forward and then backwards - (e.g., as in stuck in a loop)
	Other sphinx lair effects - a series of very very small glass serpents, young birds
3rd: A portion of the sand to the North gives way and a bright light cuts through the darkness as the underground river of molten glass consumes a portion of the Sands
	DC 15 Perception: you see a small group of ~3 humanoids in the process of sanding around the desert sink hole - they may or may not notice you...

- Zircon - youngest brother (https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/monk-of-the-scattered-sands)
### Sand Finch
Channels emotions/emotional memories from each of the party members

Some motivations:
- They're largely "frozen" in time, being so close to the lair of [[Ritavis]] - though they look upon the sphinx with respect and heed the caution that emits from the sphinx's lair.
- They're distrustful of the Dogs and have felled many;
- They're generally distrustful of everyone - they've lost some of their social graces over the thousands of years
- Are eager
