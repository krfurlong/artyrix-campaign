### Intro
> As your group finally exits the forests of Pontecita, you see before you the land elevating - gradually at first, but growing steeper and steeper as it continues, before it ends in a single dark peak - gutting out and cutting into the skyline before you. The freak storm that seemed to afflict your travels yesterday has largely calmed - the winds settling down slightly, though an annoying mist of rain persists and continues to buffet your faces every so often. As you press onward over the next 30-45 minutes, a soft grumble is felt in each of your stomachs as the adrenaline from earlier this afternoon begins fully subsiding, leaving the beginnings of a dull hunger in its place as the hours tick by. (_Roughly 6PM at this point_)
## Scaling the Volcano

> As you all begin trekking upwards, **can I get a marching order?**
> Person taking point on the path forward: survival check (DC14) to trek a good path upward. DC11 Con Save for everyone (Adv on save with a success).

1. Kryst
2. Bugsy
3. Kai
4. Aoife
5. Sybil

As you all hike up this mountain, are you doing anything in particular or passing the time in any particular way?

After roughly another hour of trekking, you arrive to a tall plateau that seems to jut outward and butt up against the tall thin peak you all have been moving towards. Vines run up the cliff, crossing and snaking upwards
- Perception check: DC16 you can barely make out the top of what looks to be a tunnel boring into the peak
- Perception/Survival: you see footprints (booted and webbed feet); 
	- The boot prints end roughly 30 feet away from the plateau's cliff-face.
	- You smell smoke, sweet smoke and the scent of seafood being cooked, likely over an open fire.
- Perc/Inv: You swear you can make out a series of three glyphs ever faintly shimmering in the evening light.

[[Pontecita Cliff Puzzle]]/encounter with the Kuo-Toa Archpriest+2 below.
**Premise**: Trio of kuo-toa are resting/sleeping - not on an active patrol. Failed movements along the cliff trigger a stealth roll vs Perception Check.

60 foot cliff: 
- +6 to stealth at bottom of cliff
- +3 to stealth at 15-30ft up
- +0 bonus at 30-45ft
- -3 to stealth at top of cliff (last 15 ft)
### A topside ambush
Koa-Toa _Archpriest_ + 2 normal kuo-toas. **Very dangerous encounter.** Archpriest Yumagluglug willing to converse with party, investigate the inner chamber. They're afraid of going in because they saw an intense arcane flash and don't want to upset their presumed god.
### Plateau's Outlook
Things to see from the vista, there's a better overlook of the island - particularly the eastern half of it.
- the western half seems to be largely covered by jungle.
- There's dunes to the north/NE
	- Perception DC12 - small/large? house amid the foothills of the mountains directly East (Teg the troll)
	- Potentially could help w/ raft building...
- Marshy swampland to the SW
- Jungle + cliff to the South (+emberfall's row)

[[Lord Emberfall]] - Symbol: hemisphere with three-"peaked" fire

## En Route Lord Emberfall's Workshop

### En Route...
> As you enter into the tunnel and leave behind the tropical climate of the outside, you're met with a dry, pungent air that seems to almost radiate from the stones of the tunnel. It is dark as you all progress onward - and inward - with the only light from the outside evening sunset quickly being lost in the first 10 minutes of your trek.

**Things along the way**:
1. A dead, charred kuo-toa (burned alive from Emberfall) --found
2. Another dead kuo-toa, with an enormous gash across their chest
	- blood image on walls of figure with wings sprouting from its back.
3. A discarded navigational/trade map Perc/Inv14

### The workshop
> After another hour of trekking through the dark tunnel, you begin to see a faint red light on the periphery of your vision; The temperature has been increasing during your journey - and the fiery light finally gives a source to the heat that's been beginning to grow oppressive in the past half hour or so.

**Things inside**
1. A small coursing flow/pool of magma that dips underneath the wall
	- Territorial mephits (king + 2 embued) potentially come out if the party is taking too long near their lair
1. Arcane Journal (discarded) behind a jagged rock/stalactite
2. Discarded spell components (gems, powdered things, that align with what was in the ledger)
3. A "fizzled up" teleportation circle - or remnants of one on the floor; Kuo-Toa blood too...
#### Journal Entry
_Those idiotic scholars of the [[Arcanum Decetto]] have sat and squandered their time and power for too long. [[The Dwindling]] is real and they have known it for decades and yet they have not acted with any resemblance of haste. The people of Artyrix deserve better - **I** deserve better._

_Perhaps they feel they derive power from this stagnant state of being. Perhaps this is why they've grown increasingly leery of my questions - of my search for knowledge and truth. Some days it seemed as if [[Harverot]] sent his flocks of spies to surveil my mundane existence. They doubt me - nay - they fear me._

_Fortuitous then, for me, that I happened to stumble across the strange creatures that resided in [[Lake Difidenzia]] whilst on a daily exodus from [[Vecchia]]. I heeded them little mind at first, but they thought me a god. How trivial it was to earn their adoration - and how it fueled my ambitions. Interacting with them, even their...esteemed...shaman taxed me and my patience, but they proved to be useful in finding the island. They called it The-place-that-exists-in-a-place-it-should-not, a bit wordy by my tastes, but it captured the essence of the place. As far as I'm aware, it seems to exhibit features only seen in [[The Northern Barrier Islands]], the way the land seems to respond to magical scarring; the way that weather responds to arcana; the way that power seems to catalyze change..._

_Regardless, what I needed was a place - a laboratory - away from the prying eyes of the Arcanum. Somewhere no one would go on purpose. Somewhere to lay wards and hone my conjuration prowess. My own spies - scouts - other devout followers looking after my wellbeing and keen to bring about my vision of the world have called my attention away from Artyrix. Curious, I had all but written off [[Jolastokia]] after that spectacle in [[Gatazka]]. Figure that mortals are nothing if not resilient. A college of sorts exists in the northern region - Arcania - that seems to be excelling in the enchantment of items of great power. Even if these wards fade when exposed to the Artyrian curse that is [[The Dwindling]], I imagine it behooves me and my interests to see how prolific they've become across the [[Eternal Sea]] - and whether I might benefit from procuring some of these artifacts, even if I may only expend them once here. I will have the truth. They cannot take that from me. I will seize it from them - or rip it from their cold fingers if they resist._ - **T.E.**

## Escaping Pontecita
[[Lord Emberfall]]'s discarded note/location his ship in within the volcano provides a clue as to a way off the island...
### Ship Captains in the region
1. [[Tobias Whalesong]] - triton captain, sailing between [[LinnÃ¦sa]] and [[Khiage]] aboard the Melodic Concord
2. [[Miranda Barnibas]] - half-elven pirate/corsair sailing frequent routes between [[Khiage]] and [[Corosiva]]
3. [[Txemas Scarletson]] - Elven captain, dealt with multiple mutinies and has lost the use of his left eye due to a large scar across it; Hard around the edges, but looks after his men provided they keep in line
4. [[Veena Autumnshade]] - female deep-gnome from [[Machivelia]]; frequents travel between the northern/western parts of that islands and around [[Havangart]]. Cheery - though quick to negotiate with pirates 
## End of the Session

> Session ended upon exiting the volcano...map to a "ship" in hand. perhaps a rumble in the distance/from underfoot?
> KAI is still cursed (HP max is reduced by 2d6 every long rest.)
