## Recap
- Dealt with morally gray/bad vibes in negotiating with [[Jasad Peatmire]] and [[The Reinvention]]
	- Gave [[Osiris Siltguard]] and [[Tau-0]] the [[Quyllurkuna Agaricus]]
	- Immediately lifted the siege of [[Havangart]]!
- Traveled safely to [[Simulcepio]]! Dodging an encounter along the way
	- Met [[Aoife]]'s parents, [[Patsy]] the town clerk, and [[Medullax]]
	- Paid to scry on [[Kailani]]'s brother, [[Nohu]]

## Intro
As the last lights of day dip under the horizon, a great tent lifts up in the center of [[Simulcepio]] until it remains suspended - its peak perhaps 100ft in the air. Almost immediately, warm soft light surrounds the center of town - seeping in from some unknown source as it gently lights the paths around town to guide folks in towards the performance venue. While seemingly very much distributed and disorganized, word spreads quickly of the upcoming show - an unannounced treat, buoyed even higher with whispers of [[Aoife]]'s back! - similarly spreading like wildfire around town. As you all follow the steady stream of folks heading into the tent, your eyes dart from spectacle to spectacle as you begin to fully take in the wonder and artful prowess of the [[Clann Na Cursa]].

### The Main Performance
General vibes of things are not what they appear to be

- Kenku “barker” goes by the name Abe
	- Speaks spanish - not an actual kenku but actually someone trapped in the form of a Kenku
> ¡Bienvenidos todos! Esta noche tendrán el privilegio de ver a algunos de los artistas más destacados y extravagantes jamás vistos en el Mar Eterno. Observen a los trapecios caminar de puntillas sobre hielo, fuego, espadas y abismos. Maravíllense con la historia y las enseñanzas de los grandes tamborileros enanos. Observen la trayectoria de la industria y su conquista a manos del mismísimo Arte. Y, por supuesto, deleiten sus oídos con el canto de sirena de quienes cantan la canción de todos los bardos que los precedieron. Sumérjanse en la maravilla, el misterio, y nunca duden en preguntarse: "¿Es realmente real lo que veo ante mí?".
	Disfruten del espectáculo.

- Three dwarven siblings (two male and one “bearded lady”: [[Novek]], [[Tinrim]], and [[Velda]]) who tell stories through taiko drummer on anvils, the sparks from the anvil, their movements, and chanting tell stories mostly inspired by Dwarven history, and present (Dwarven Civil War) All three are fleeing conscription into the war and were branded with Moradin’s hammer on their left forearms even though they’re not followers of Moradin
	- Story of dwarves being crafted in the image of the Moradin; But others also exist - other dwarves in the pantheon 

> A brief pause in the mania arrives - as slowly, three dwarven figures wheel out three large anvils - each roughly the same size of the dwarf pulling it onto the main performance stage. A short later  - a methodical pulsing begins to fill the air as each of the figures - wielding a hammer in each hand relentlessly drums upon the massive anvils. In the midst of this steady beat, everyone in the tent enters an enraptured meditation as the figures continue their steady cadence. 2, 5, maybe 10 minutes go past in this trance before all realize the intensity of these figures pounding of hammer on anvil has led the hammers themselves to grow red with heat. Without missing a beat, each of the drummers in turn casts a small handful of sand upon the anvil just before striking it with their mallet - sending a flash of colorful ash and sparks up into the air. As the sparks drift downward, you notice they fall almost as if suspended in time and for a moment - they even appear to look like something...For the remainder of the performance, you focus on these sparks, the dwarven chanting, and the complex story each of these elements weave before your eyes:
		- You see... an impossibly large dwarven figure emerging from earth itself and cupping a large piece of clay and stone in their hand - forming it and molding it until it looked as a smaller version of the entity itself
		- You see - the new smaller form grow, forming others like it in the image of its creator, and spreading throughout a great mountain range
		- You see civilization - religion and devotion to their creator god spring up, but also curiosity, art, commerce, and craft.
		- You watch as steam begins to sputter onto the anvils as you realize tears have welled up in the eyes of the drummers as the figures in this great society turn on one another: one side pointing to their one creator and another pointing to a host of similarly divine figures, or gesturing to the wider world of other non-dwarven figures around them.
		- The steam grows thicker - almost resembling landslides and gunpowder discharges as it's backlit by the still flying sparks, as conflict tears through the people, ripping a once united people into two.
		- You see dwarves on both sides fleeing the mountains, seeing the sky for the very first time, and even finding the courage to leave their homeland altogether and sail off upon the Eternal Sea in hopes of refuge, escape, and secrecy...
		- The vision lifts as the drumming continues - although beginning to slow now, the three performers growing physically and emotionally weary of the toll exacted on them before it intensifies for one last passage and a collective "ho!" from the trio as sparks showered down upon them 

- Kobold tumblers / acrobats, don’t let your art be used for the system. They were a small piece of a bigger picture and they didn’t see what their actions were doing. The message is that industry and capitalism are destroying our natural world and art for art’s sake. The Chen family often add effects to this act. 
	- Along w/ Jaime & [[Zhuli Chen]]'s kids: ~4 years old (Renn, Pei, and Tzeng)
	- Chen's adding in illusions to depict 
- [[Nerida]] (NEH-ree-dah) a mermaid told stories by swimming through water that her water genasi lover, named [[Mizu]], creates for her, belly dancing vibes, dark twist, she only tells stories through dance because her tongue was cut out. Sailors thought she was a siren and wanted to prevent her from seducing them through song.
- Pierre Nonsecrete - a young elven teenager who is a mime
	- In true mime fashion, the things he pantomimes become real whenever he's performing - so he's always chitchatty whenever he's _not_ on stage.
 - Panorama "Pan" Carter - a female chronomancer dancer, her act involves splitting herself into past, present, and future and dancing with herself (a la a looper in music)
	- Main act is one that depicts an enslaved woman who is only freed upon leaping out of a window and realizing her inner-druidic powers
- Doppelganger bard - performing at [[Aoife]]'s father...and mother...and then itself

> As the night draws onward, the intensity and excitement of the crowd grows ever higher until cutting through the din of the crowd you all hear someone strike a chord. [[Aoife]], you immediately recognize the jovial and lilting voice of your father as appearing from behind a curtain he steps - wearing one of his old gig costumes that you only have seen him wear maybe once or twice before. He eyes glowing with excitement, he seems to take it all in as he slowly saunters around the raised performance space, singing a familiar folk song: "[[On the Dusty Dunes of Dynistia]]"
> At the third verse, your father slips back behind the curtain for a moment taking his cue from the must. Much to your delight and surprise, [[Aoife]]'s mother joins in the song with her lilting timbre, just in time - although interestingly enough, she's picked up the accompaniment from the concertina and exits from the curtain strumming a lute - not particularly well but better than you [[Aoife]] recall her being in the past.
> Similarly before the final verse, the lead singer disappears behind the curtain before emerging playing a fiddle now - not [[Cairan O’Shananhan]] or [[Aine McPhee]], but rather [[Sybil]] slips out from the curtain to wrap up the performance...or at least it certainly looks like Sybil as you all immediately whip your eyes to her sitting very much in the audience.
> Figure locks eyes with [[Sybil]] as she/they sing this final verse.
> At the outro: the revert to their true form - a doppelganger, cheering out in an eerie voice, pitched somewhat low, but in an almost whispery tone that still cut through the space like a rapier:
> 		So raise up your tankard and listen to me,
		There is aid in the dust and a light in the gloom!
		***(Spoken, with a thump on the table):***
		To the Leonin Witch who saved me from doom!
		To Dynist! ***Sláinte**!*

### Entreacts from [[Nerida]]
Chapter 1
Nerida long black hair teal tail and scales that cover partsnof her torso deep navy blue eyes Music begins it joyful dance tune there’s singing but no words the water starts to churn slightly and turns a lilac color her dance begins and it’s carefree. Lots of spins and twists it almost seems like there are two of her dancing together. In the shadows and light from her scales you see the sillouette of a lagoon with many figures lounging swimming and playing. You see two of them share a kiss and far off in the distance ships sail by as the music fades 

Chapter 2
The music starts in the same way and the way has turned an orange color like sunset the dance starts much the same for she even as the music changes, the harmony is modulating to a minor key although the melody stays the same creating distance and unease. Merida dancers unaware that the shadow of a ship looms closer. In the shadows you seen figures in the ship growing larger. They seem to catch sight of Nerida and her dance and there a flurry of activity on deck. At the end of spin Nerida seems the ship approach and stops suddenly as does the singing. The music fades. 

Chapter 3 
The music begins this time far more rhythmic, think Rite of Spring. The water is far more choppy more and is a deeper red. The dance is much more restrained and st the very bottom of the tank. She hides her faces with her hair and the shadows are the main even in the section. The shadow sailors rush the lagoon and attack the merfolk on the shore. Merida continues to dance and the singing is high pitched and frantic a la American psycho, as the massacre ends we see neeida tears streaming down here face slowly rise back to the center of the tank. Suddenly she is slammed against the side of the tank her mouth wide in a scream you see she has no tongue. Black out.
