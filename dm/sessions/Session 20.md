## Recap
After a busy day at sea and interrupted sleep the night before, you all fall asleep hard after a long first day exploring the low areas of [[Rusted Keys]]. 
_Bugsy: Make a Wisdom saving throw._
The honkytonk-esque sounds of the piano downstair still somewhat plunking away into the early hours of the morning, you awake the next morning nonetheless well rested. Early squawks of seagulls stir you awake, as the bright sun peeks through your closed, but somewhat offset and crooked window shutters. A warm and hazy day awaits you all as collect yourselves downstairs, fed some standard breakfast fare, and gather around to discuss your plans for the day.
## Key quest lines
1. [[The Black Phoenix]], a ship whose crew are devoted to [[The Reinvention]], coasts into the Dusty Docks area of [[Rusted Keys]], in the Iron Filings District. The dockhand [[Ferbin Bubblesnooker]] is paid/sworn to secrecy and might be able to be coerced with coin (~500gp) and no way of tracing back to him.
	1. Ferbin has connections to a crime syndicate ([[The Stallignment]]) that runs primarily out of [[New Sigil]]/[[Île Follette]] --> loosely affiliated with [[The Kismet]], there's likely a banner that [[Bugsy]] may notice that alludes to this
	2. The ship was badly battered and set ablaze (by Dr. Shoals in haste) and is in need of repairs before returning to the siege 
		1. At the Dusty Docks, only the upper mast and raised helm areas are not submerged - the remainder appears sunken under water (getting repaired...?)
		2. The ship itself bears no markings or flags outside of its name
			1. Hidden in a chest tucked inside the vessel (underwater) is it's banner - a red glaive like looking symbol upon a piece of black fabric
			 ![[Pasted image 20250405194427.png]]
	3. Captain is a pale gaunt looking figure [[Yama Iscarbo]], accompanied by a piscine looking first mate, [[Carx Slithbane]]. 
		1. Stat blocks: https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/sword-wraith-commander, and https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/sea-spawn
			1. Yama summons other sword wraith warriors if engaged in combat to round out the crew
		2. Yama is friendly with [[Osiris Siltguard]] - and crossed paths with him briefly while enroute to Rusted Keys
		3. Yama is aware that Osiris ran into a shifter warrior but not by name ([[Nohu]], Kai's brother). Acc to Osiris, Nohu was exhausted upon reaching their vessel and put up little fight - they shackled him, and sold him as a servant to the first vessel that crossed paths with them (a slaver merchant from [[The Ascendent]] headed towards [[East Foundry]] - but Yama is unaware of these specifics)
			1. [[Carx Slithbane]] suspects the vessels was headed towards [[Île Follette]] given the description of the vessel and its "cargo" but withholds this info unless it may be used as a bargaining chip later...
	4. Onboard cargo/hints:
		1. INV 12, Hidden under captains bed: Gold 300gp, likely to cover the costs of minor repairs to their vessel
		2. INV DC18: Hidden under the floorboards leading down to belowdecks, a small chest+note: chest contents == a "half use" of the mushroom of interest to [[The Reinvention]]: Quyllurkuna Agaricus, which with a full use **mimics the effects of the Astral Projection spell**, allowing the user to immediately seek answers from people's and entities long departed (3 questions?)
		3. INV DC20: amongst the dust left by Yama if killed is the Locket of the Creeping Death. Once per week, it may be opened to cast the cloudkill spell at 5th level.
			1. It moves 10 feet towards the living creature with the most hit points each round (initiative count 20).
