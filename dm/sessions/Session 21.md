- They semi-completed the [[Clearing the Iron Vein]] sub-quest, allowing the large magmoid creature to escape into the jungles to the northeast instead endangering themselves further

## Intro paragraph
With your newly acquired coin in hand, activity around the Iron Filing district begins to largely calm down and settle as shops begin the process of closing up for the night. Across the lagoon, the sun is beginning to make its way towards the horizon as evening draws nigh. Still on your first _full_ day in [[Rusted Keys]], you regroup together in the marketplace to plan your next endeavors for your evening.
### Red Lantern District

> Crossing through the more mercantile Eros Marina, you pass through a gate to take you to the outskirts of town. Immediately the character of the buildings changes as the run-down, grubby and soot stained warehouses are replaced by softly lit, newly stained wooden taverns, hovels, and small performance spaces. Small red lanterns float throughout the main thoroughfare, lining the street and casting a glowing light onto the faces of those wandering these roads at this hour of day...

Things to note:
1. Madame Peregrine's Nest of the Night: a dignified looking, fluffy robed falconess (Madame Peregrine) from [[Linnæsa]] offers nightly encounters of the more intimate variety (5gp - 75 gp)
	1. Rabbitfolk: brown-tan rabbit named Brooke Cottontail
	2. Owlin: black, white flecked owl named Cooroo
	3. tabaxi: calico cat named Lotti
	4. Most expensive tier comes with a 1 question divination (moment of clarity)
2. Experience Emporium: joint venture performance art space between some artists from [[Havangart]] and some of [[The Orinoco]] from [[Île Follette]]. (25 gp entry)
	1. Small satchel of drugs provided upon entry
		1. Posted sign apologizing for the limited amount - need to ration given the trade barricade coming out of [[Havangart]]
	2. Performance is _super_ vibey, deep ambient strings from a cadre of cellos fill the dimly lit space - no touching, just folks positioning themselves in odd angles on the stage for ~2 hours
	3. Super heighted senses - adv on perception checks for the duration of the show
3. Drink Up Me Heart - a somewhat cringy pirate-themed burlesque show run by some folks out of [[Charterstown]], owner is a gussied up hobogoblin employed elven, gnomish, and human actors (15 gp entry)
	1. Show is coded, but not super discretely. DC10 insight/history largely making fun of the northern [[Briny Armada]] 
	2. bustling bar - lots of people as this place seems to attract a larger crowd of sailors
4. Guard Post - 4 troops bearing the insignia of the Viceroy are posted up, couriers dash back and forth between all of the brothels for quick validation, approval, and logging
	1. Lieutenant Carinar (elven) on point here
### Rumors to overhear amid the performances
- ...it really goes to show how opportunistic he is. Do I think someone else needed to open up shop and provide some competition to lower Aguatia's rates? Absolutely. Do I think that person needed to offer up their services to every ship no matter their colors nor creed - including those that so clearly jeopardize our existing contracts? Certainly not.
- Ferbin is playing with fire whether he can see it or not over the pile of gold he's amassing. Hopefully that gnome doesn't believe in blood money - otherwise, I'm sure he'll be haunted for the rest of his life
- That road to [[Belemi]] lit up on fire earlier today as if getting there wasn't hard enough already. Aides to Junctos said that he was pissed - given the current conditions of the [[Eternal Sea]] around there, my money is on needing to contract with the [[Briny Armada]] for provisions lest our people up there starve
- Just got back from my last patrol - just saw the craziest thing: ship was on fire, effectively 90% burnt and scraped, and managed to float right into the Dusty Docks as if the tides just brought it in from sea. Fortuitous - even saw someone manage to get off in time before it fully went under. I wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of that bill...
- ...keep your revelry short tonight, maties, just got word from the captain that we've finished up repairs on [[The Torment]]. We're needed back at the blockade per some orders that have come down from on high from Osiris - need to replace [[The Black Phoenix]] which just washed in.
## Stopping the Torment
A small group of 2 pirates depart [[Rusted Keys]] - contested perception/stealth check to determine if they spot you following them. If so, the escape counter increases by 1 automatically.

Back story: ship was damaged by the [[Briny Armada]] in an early attempt to break the barricade. The ship's captain gives ghast energy pale skin, sickly green tongue, and is named Capt Benjamin Theosa. Ties to the Theosa family in [[Île Follette]] who are a notable family in [[The Defiant]]. (Bugsy potentially roll history DC 15 to recall this fact).

Loot: 
- 2 functional cannons
- 400gp
- 4 health potions
- 1 potion of water-walking
- Ship log:
	- Havantgart
	- Doubtfire
	- [[Wahatan]]
	- [[Altalos]]
	- miscellaneous islands in [[The Northern Barrier Islands]]
