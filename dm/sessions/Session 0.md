## An Intro to Artyrix
- Quick overview of the campaign setting
	- Lots of islands! Action, plots, mysteries are common across each and every one of them
		- Off-shoot almost entirely separate civilization from Jolastokia; though if you're interested in some cross-over, let me know and pitch your case
	- Magic items are _struggling_. 
		- Alchemy is filling the void here - lots more potions, and generally expendable items
		- Ex. also spell scrolls
		- Arcana-technology/magic-tech also surging and far more common across many of the islands
	- Strong similarities to ancient Greek mythology where the distinction between man, heroes, and the divine is sometimes blurred, and even goes back-and-forth
	- Established political regimes are generally less common with some exceptions ([[Machivelia]], [[Île Follette]], [[Dynistia]] to some extent)
		- Factions are all the rage - local, more fluid but weirder collections of people
		- Joining a faction is *encouraged*. Engaging one or more factions in pursuit of a larger goal is likely *the norm*.

## Campaign Goals
- Some High level goals for the of campaign 
	- More than Jolastokia, I'd really love for this campaign to be more sandbox-y
		- Have an idea/theme for a city or town; or a political regime; or a faction? Let me know! Let's make it happen!
		- I'm really interested in the collaborative story-telling aspect to see what we can all do here so that we're telling the types of stories we want to tell and enjoy exploring
	- There are lots of islands - we don't need to explore them all!
	- From an "intensity" standpoint, I'm trying to target things less *pressing* than last campaign
		- I will lean more on tropes, allusions, direct references than I did in the past
		- I may try to throw "situations" at players instead of specific challenges; I may not have pre-determined solutions for these dilemmas, which therefore may require more PC driven ideas.
		- We all may invert or upset those tropes and callbacks as much as we'd like
	- There will be more space allowed for downtime, longstanding/reoccurring NPC relationships, and time to explore side-quests/backstories, regardless of plot-centrality
	- As these goals/themes align to character creation: I want you to explore/play characters that mesh your mental image
		- If that means bending, tweaking, or completely modifying a class/subclass or updating a feature --> cool, let me know and we'll work on it
		- Swapping out abilities? Sure!
		- Re-speccing your character? Give me a heads up and let me know we want to add an in-campaign motivation/event driving the change
		- Want to roll up a new person entirely? Sure! Let me know in advance 
## Character Creation
- You have two options for stats:
	- 75 points to allocate across your 6 stats
	- Roll for stats (drop lowest of each);
		- 2x 4d4 
		- 2x 4d6
		- 2x 2d4;1d6;2d8
		- Stipulations: Maximum stat of 20 in anything. Anything over 20 you **must** rollover into another stat *or* give to another player who has not met the 72 point rule.
		- **72 Point Rule**: If the sum of all of your stats is lower than 72, you may re-roll any one stat of your choice. (You may continue doing this until you're at or above 72 points).
- Rolling for debt time (if you haven't already)!
	- Roll 3d8 and multiply that value by 100.
- For those of you who haven't already seen, please review the [[Family Heirlooms]] list and ensure to incorporate one into your backstory
- Think about and select your feat
## General Questions
1. Long, multi (in-game) day dungeons? Yes or No?
2. PC deaths? Should the DM actively avoid them, pursue them, or neither?
3. Related question: should some fights/quests be setup to be outside of the party's current level?
## Group Backstory Creation Prompts (Time pending)
