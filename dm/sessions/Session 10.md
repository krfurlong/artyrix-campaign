Title: The Fall of House Neyender?
<hr>

## Recap
*Party recap.*

Sybil + Bugsy on the boat.

> The sun peaks out over the horizon on the Eternal Sea, shedding light on the majority of your party - wind battered from the elements and generally exhausted from the tumultuous journey  spanning the past three and a half hours (e.g., roughly 8:30). The full light of day, however, is a welcome change of pace as your vessel begins drifting towards the most precarious, debris ridden area surrounding the island of [[Corosiva]], that region around [[The Dueling Straights]]. Already in the early morning light, those of you on the ship see two small vessels what you assume are assuredly Scavenger ships patrolling around the waters before you, assumedly more are following you and will arrive closer to the time of the Duel scheduled for 9am.

## Din before the Storm...
> Those of you who remained on land, however, we'll start with you (two?) as you awake decently well-rested (take a long rest), though still somewhat rattled from your encounter in the courtyard the day before and perhaps slightly unnerved at the task before you later this morning. 

[[Kryst]] - Make a Wisdom save (vs Scrying...) as Quzy tries to ascertain whether he's safe or not; 

> **Is there anything you want to do before heading to the Straights?**

- Most shops are likely closed or closing down, various merchants might be found along the way
	- souvenir pop-up stalls (mock replicas of Tennysons suit, posters/flyers from the event)
	- bookies: odds of [[Remus Neyender]] winning are posted at 1:500.
		- Ironically this leads most folks to chip in a few coins in Remus's favor, but nobody is really betting against [[Arthur Tennyson]]...
- The Neyender residence is largely boarded up - as Ruida was bustled away from the potential carnage. Rollins went ahead with Remus.
	- Faedyn Neyender - Remus's mother - (employed a doppleganger to take her place at the Duel as she goes to wait/hope in [[Underscrew]]).
- Other members of the nobility and upper elite make their way via coaches/carriages
	- [[General Lutskyiv]] in a heavily armored carriage pulled by 4 warhorses, troop of 3 guards+1 gladiator
### The fight
1. Description of Tennyson (Gurney pic; see [[Arthur Tennyson]]+ his suit (4 arms - 2 of which are psionically bound/connected)
2. Horn + drums to signal the moments leading up to the fight
	1. Decree from the Court laying out the charges
	2. Crowds packed in the stands (likely the 2 party members too...unless stated otherwise)
3. Tennyson's suit glimmers with a light purple sheen upon beginning the fight. He takes a few steps towards Remus before chiding the child - teasing him and offering him the first blow.
	1. Stats from Suit include capabilities in [[Session 9#Mech Actions - LAIR/Initiative 20.]]
	2. Physical attacks against Tennyson's suit **also** charge up a burst/retaliation attack (which is what Tennyson is actively doing to start the fight.)

#### The fight:
- 7 turns
- (2 turns to fall)
- 
## Situation on the Sea...
1. The party will likely not be within 60 feet of [[Remus Neyender]] should he fall off shortly before beginning combat
	1. As is, they will be **120 feet away** from point of impact.
2. The two Scavenger Ships patrolling the waters underneath [[The Dueling Straights]] are aggressively trying to defend their turf (e.g., they called dibs and woke up first)
	1. NPCs:
		1. [[The Flotsam Flea]] - captain is Scurg (male half-orc), crew of 3 goblins.
		2. [[The Jealous Jackal]] - captain Hoond (male, somewhat crazed gnoll (pack lord)); crew of 2 [gnoll flesh gnawers](https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/gnoll-flesh-gnawer)
	2. The two ships are in a tentative alliance to spook off other scavenger vessels. they'll move to intercept if either is approached. They're generally distrustful of the other
3. Sailing around the area is fraught with debris and wreckage from earlier duels. But some things might be found in the water that could be helpful if the group looks
	1. Propulsion boots/booster with a two charges (DC18 Inv). "Fly speed" of 50ft/"turn" (but then falls down...); **inside of 10**
	2. A Leaking freeze ray system: 1 charge, modified cone of cold to "place" 10 10ft "cubes" of ice up to 60 feet away **outside edge of 6**
	3. a fog machine: casts fog cloud **outside of 9**
	4. Flubber boots: double one's high/long jump once per short rest without fear of falling damage; or triples one's long/high jump with a DC 15 athletics/acrobatics or take 4d6 bludgeoning on landing **inside of 13**
	5. Inflation system: an unexpended "airbag" system within the shell of a former mech-suit. Must remove former user who's very much dead though creepy and sea briny before use. **far side of 2**

### Sailing around objects
1. Ship is a 10x20 (roughly). Can only turn 1 "angle" per movement forward
2. "Squeezing" through tight spaces where there's less clearance requires a Wisdom check/survival or the hull suffers 2d10 damage; 1d10 if fails less than 5.
	1. No clearance: DC 18
	2. 1 space clearance: DC 15
	3. 2 space clearance: DC12
### Dangers around the Straights
1. 2 semi-negotiable ships ([[The Flotsam Flea]] and [[The Jealous Jackal]]).
2. 3 incoming, less forgiving but small schooners (2 people per ship; 2d8 + 3 damage; +5 to hit grappling gun --> cuts movt in half)
3. electromagnetic surges around some of the more active debris areas (2d8; Con save 13)
4. Incoming [[Kikai]]'s vessel on the distance/horizon...

## Post-Fight
- [[Quzy Akone]] still fashioned in Zeeq (half-elven rogue) attire/disguise likely surveilling the scene from a polluted beach like area on the western end of [[Corosiva]].
- Closer to the straights, you may catch sight of a small banner (DC20 perception) in a hidden cove built into the eastern island ([[Underscrew]])
## Beyond Corosiva...
1. Shipwrecked individual, pigeon-folk (Luma race), ~20s, named: Pirio. Caught up in a spat between pirates and some bardic troupe from [[Havangart]].
	1. Pirio's ship was traveling from [[Ruddy Rock]] up towards [[Corsair's Cove]] on a diplomatic mission, information gathering affair on behalf of [[The Parliament]].
	2. Likely drifted for the better part of a day - conflict was in the north west.
2. Sea monsters?
	1. Young Mercury dragon named Hydrargio playing in the waters, if they can be detected.
