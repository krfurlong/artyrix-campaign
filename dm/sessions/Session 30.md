## Intro
As the wall of fungi literally part before you, your group exits the realm of [[The Painted Turtles]] and returns to the noxious exterior under the oversight of [[The Reinvention]]. The sight before you is nearly unchanged to when you departed maybe 12 hours ago - 6 hulking undead entities plod back and forth, [[Tau-0]] waits unwaveringly with their metallic hand outstretched. Only the shorter pile of bodies actively alight on the still burning pyre would give any indication that time had passed. With the spores drifting passively aside, the metallic voice of [[Tau-0]] breaks through this otherwise feylike reverie state: 
> My internal sensors detect you were successful in your quest. Present to us the [[Quyllurkuna Agaricus]] and we shall fulfill our end of the pre-arranged agreement.

### Other notes from [[Tau-0]]
- [[Jasad Peatmire]] was keen to see this through, but was drawn to sea this morning. He sends his regrets and his most sincere thanks
	- He's "here" in this chamber and watching everything - will speak through others in the area if needed to exert his presence
	- Currently was called to a meeting of the [[Arcanum Decetto]], where he passes as [[Ignacio Willowrend]] - where he was urging patience at the disappearance of [[Lord Emberfall]] and not to go out searching for him
- He's delegated [[Osiris Siltguard]] to be his proxy on land should you need to discuss any additional matters.
	- Otherwise, the sooner the conversation wraps, the sooner [[The Reinvention]] will get asea and the sooner the siege will be lifted
## Conversations with [[Osiris Siltguard]]
- Admits readily that he didn't know [[Kailani]] and [[Nohu]] were related
	- Also honestly would admit that he's never seen [[Kai]] before this most recent interaction
- If the party "behaves" he may share that [[Nohu]] was left roughly:
	- NW of [[Machivelia]], SE of [[Île Follette]]
	- He may or may not share that: Nohu's location was shared with a friend of the clan - a slaver merchant, half-giant named [[Skriff the Squinter]],  from [[The Ascendent]] headed towards [[East Foundry]]
- [[Osiris Siltguard]] did not conduct the raid on the island to retrieve [[The Turnstone Sigil]], but he did oversee the raid from sea 
	- Escort [[Katya the Carrion]] - a hag-touched Hexblood necromancer/warlock - away form [[Linnæsa]], around [[Machivelia]].
	- [[Katya the Carrion]] is currently conducting experiments on the stone in lost ruins in the Eastern desert of [[Dynistia]]
		- Getting aid from [[Rogi Cafir]]...
### Reinvention terms on successful retrieval
- Leave [[Havangart]] immediately (take the to [[Eternal Sea]]), thus ending the siege
- Optionally, restore the fertility and vibrancy of the land
- Potentially, intel on [[Nohu]]
- Branded Blade of the Initiate (att)
	- 1d6 scimitar + 1 magic + 1d4 necrotic damage
		- 1/turn you can choose to gain Temporary HP equal to the 1d4 necrotic damage
		- If the individual is branded, the base damage of this weapon increases to 1d10 and the necrotic damage increases to 1d6
	- (Cursed) Whenever you kill a creature with this weapon, the ripples of your deed reverberate across the Beyond causing all Commanders of [[The Reinvention]] know your location.

## Paths to [[Simulcepio]]
- By tunnels
	- Searching through the second level of [[The Fermenti Caverns]] and following any advice of [[Grainne]] leads to the long tunnel path that eventually ends underneath [[Hounga Kalfou]]'s abode in the island next to [[Simulcepio]]
		- ~4 hours into the trek: burrow holes and rumblings underfoot betray the presence of a black bulette (DC15 nature/survival)
			- https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/black-bulette -- lesser version
			- AC --> 17, HP --> 175, DCs-->16
			- Upon killing it, the outer shell appears fractured and a thick black smoke begins seeping out slowly.
			- [[Timur Stripesbane]], british sounding, a dastardly Raksasha, emerges in a dwarven form, going by the name **Geralt Brimstone**
				- Super grateful to be out and free - offers a favor in exchange for freeing him from the shell of the beast
				- Recalls that he either lost a bet in Dis or saw this as an opportunity to sneak out
					- Frankly, not a bad idea - wonder how savvy the Material Plane is to these creatures and the opportunities they present
				- Likely need to get home - I had a shop back home before I caught the attention of the Tower. I suspect I've laid low long enough that I can go back to that without catching too much flack from the authorities....
		- Just underneath [[Hounga Kalfou]]'s home, a pocket of mushrooms that all function as spell component replacements for legend lore.
			- If harvested improperly or used unwisely, these have the effect of more intense trips - potentially false. e.g., casting Dream, etherealness, teleport...
- Above ground:
	- Unless convinced otherwise, [[The Reinvention]] takes all ships and vessels with them as they hastily depart
	- Trekking by land, you follow a strip of land that largely bares the scars of [[The Reinvention]] as you head towards [[Simulcepio]]
		- [[Aoife]] - you follow the path, a more familiar one to you though the outside world and trees bare no similarity to those you viewed in your youth
	- Roughly 2 hours into your journey, you finally begin to exit the truly clear cut, desolate forested area and look inwards towards a thicker part of the forest
		- DC20 perception check to see 2 dryads - glaring stoically and angrily towards your party
			- they presume you've come to extend the deforestation carnage
			- De-escalating the situation requires a quick and thoughtful action
				- They only speak druidic and elvish
			- They - along with a Splinter Drake - serve as guardians of this glen
