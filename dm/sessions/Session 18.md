Title: 
<hr>

## Recap points
- Party fought the Bandersniff (Top-Dog), and destroyed the core functions in the [[Domain of Dogs]]
	- Aided by a crew of recruits - almost all of who died in the fighting
	- Party learned more about the bandersniff's history, and some of the recent communications this creature seemingly had with the outside world (including [[Osiris Siltguard]])
	- [[Bugsy]] fails vs Jackalwere curse
	- Start with [[Krystabald]] identifying the vials of blood (req. roll for success)
## Intro
Beaten and battered from your foray into the [[Domain of Dogs]], your party emerges victorious - much to the excitement of [[Quzy Akone]] who cheers as you exit, his cries shifting to muffled sobs at seeing how few of his followers accompanied you out as you exited the gates. Wordlessly, he rushes over to Bofur and Tofur, the dwarves, badly bloodied as they are, and scoops an arm underneath both to help them remain upright. "Rest" he speaks softly to you - Kryst - before continuing: "I'll meet you all in the morning; I'm sure there are more than a few pitched tents available for you all."

### Identifying the vials
Back at the tents, you all gather around [[Krystabald]] as he begin tracing out a series of runic glyphs in the charcoal colored floor neath your feet - the glow from a nearby crackling fire casting light and dancing shadows from underneath all of your faces. Kryst, you finish tracing the last Glyph and with a tug on your glove, a rush of information floods to your senses - as if it had always been on the tip of your tongue: 
Crimson vial
> "Blood: Drawn from the mortal from of a creature not one week prior. The character of the blood had begun to erode - yet a dark essence beyond which anything you've ever encountered before almost radiates from the vial. An affliction - uncurable by almost all means short of divine intervention - of that you are sure, and one that would surely transform the afflicted into a beast unrecognizable to that of their former self."

Bright red/yellow streaked vial (what Bugsy had)
> "Blood: Drawn from the mortal from of a creature perhaps 2 weeks hence. The blood itself is thin, which only draws your attention to the clear curse that is encapsulated within it. While lycanthropic in nature, the severity of this malady is somewhat muted, as if a less potent - but still very real and present. It may be cured via spiritual processes or via rare but not unheard of medicinal means. If left untreated, the curse will progressively overwhelm the host **(1hr per day on a failed DC10 wisdom save.)** until they lose full knowledge of the person they used to be.
### Dreams that night
Bugsy - you have a hard time getting to sleep as right as you're going down, you feel a few beads of sweat begin to form on your brow - tossing and twisting on the bed roll for a what feels like hours though, you finally drift off and settle into an uneasy sleep:

(+3 wisdom save)

_cue film noir music_

> Rain. You've always liked the rain - but on this night, you were just looking for an escape from it all. 416 Modern Sigil Era, 2 months post-transfer to New Sigil Metro, and back solidly on what felt like the goddamn bottom rung of the food chain once more.

> The city wasn't new to you at this point, but this district - this crisscrossing of streets and avenues, of thoroughfares that invert and twist into the sky - this was new territory for you. And as you pushed into that dimly lit cabaret that night after pulling yet another double-shift -- the only thing familiar was that ever present feeling of corruption and darkness that seemed to seep into every crack in this city's walls. The scent of cheap whiskey and cheaper still tobacco smoke fills your nostrils my nostrils as you instinctively case the joint, casually - you're off the clock now, you reminder yourself.
> Packed with the usual suspects, their eyes heavy with secrets and unspoken desires. Scummy folk, for sure - you think to yourself - but not criminal. The hum of conversations and the clinking of glasses faded into the background as your instincts lead you away from the bar and towards a near deserted corner of the joint, where a single spotlight illuminated a figure unlike any you've seen before. 
> A vision of beauty amidst the grit and grime. The woman's voice, sultry and smooth as velvet, caressed the air as she sang: her words hanging like smoke in the hazy atmosphere. A red dress hugged her curves, shimmering under the flickering stage lights. And as she looked out onto the crowded bar of disinterested patrons, it only made sense that she started a bit when she finally locked eyes on you - and in that moment - even if it was just a moment, you finally let your guard down. 

❗Bugsy **DC10 wisdom save**: Or lose 1 hour of stability (non-jackalwere).❗

### Quzy in the morning
> I know the entire crew didn't make it back - but for what it's worth, you all did something really special for [[The Lost Change]] yesterday. I haven't seen this crew breath a sigh of relief that deeply and sleep that soundly since....well gosh since we realized those canine neighbors didn't want us around. So...thank you. Not just for helping me, but really for helping all of us down here. With them gone, we can finally really start focusing on what's beneath us instead of worrying about what's next to us.
- It's not much - but I think it's only right to offer up to you all _something_ in return for all you've done:
	-1d100: https://obelisk.daerma.com/assets/uploads/files/1563060660430-ioun-stones.pdf
		- Up to 3 "re-dos" on a re-attunement, each time its ability is randomized.
		- [[Krystabald]] gets a +1 magic DC/attack

- Not sure what your next plans are...but I think it's probably best if I stick around this level a bit to clear out any remaining mechanical dogs, maybe do some scrap runs to see if anything over there is salvageable. 
- My plan is to prep for whatever is coming next: Hopefully I'll stumble across something big and arcane that I can handjam into some sorta contraption that'll do me some good when we go back down. 
	- If not, at the least, I can start working with some of our best scavengers, scouts, and fighters to hone their skills a bit so that when we do get down there, we're able to bring some support. They're not ready now, but give them a couple months and I suspect they'll be ready.
## Next options
- Continue downward?
	- Assuming the group will head straight to level 5 in [[The Endless Pits]]
		- [[Wonderland Weirdness]]
- Sailing up to...[[Khiage]] per tips for [[Kailani]]'s brother?
- Sailing to [[Havangart]] to look into a passage to Level 5 of the pits (e.g.,  [[The Looking Glass]])

### Ascending the Pits
Passing through Level 1 will require dealing with [[The Scrapborn]]. At this point, the deputy [[Granaa]] has been posted up and waiting for the party to arrive/ascend with 4 other guards + 3 worgs
	- Granaa (goblin) https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/hobgoblin-devastator
	- 4 troops (2 attacks per troop): https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/hobgoblin-trooper
	- 3 worgs: https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/worg

As soon as your platforms stops lifting and you begin to grow aware of your surroundings on the 1st level down of the pits, you hear a gravelly high voice ring out, saying: "Now you can just freeze right there - nobody move or your whole crew is gonna meet the bottom of this pit faster than you can say 'well shit'." (Granaa speaking).
As your eyes flick around: (perception check for those w/ dark vision, DC16 to see troops, dc19 to see Granaa)

"Your group has been a bit of a thorn in our sides. You newcoming folk can't just barge through our territory and think you'll get by without consequence. Now, pay up - the flat passthrough fee (5/gp per person plus an additional 10/gp from last time (includes a fee)). Or we'll scrape it from your bloodied unconscious bodies before sending back up for [[Duncan]] to sort out."

## Fleeing Delver
- **Rusthaven neighborhood**: 
	- [[The Shining Gem]] is plastered with even more 'Wanted' posters from when you last saw it
		- Upon closer inspection, a handful actually resemble crude drawings of most of you...except for Kryst
		- "By Order of [[Arthur Tennyson]], a reward of 25GP per party member brought before him; Or 300gp for the entire crew."
		- [[Destes Akone]] is understandably worried and pissed, some indication that she may have been targeted for information
			- From folks who recognized the posters when you were in here earlier
- **Edge District**
	- [[The Hobby Pot]] - an enormous junkyard;
		- parts of it are organized almost categorically, but newer parts seem less cohesive
		- Run by [[Duncan]] - with the assistance of a contract from [[Arthur Tennyson]] who's now largely funding the operation
		- **"Mr. Bath Time"** - Constructed an enormous crane and series of alchemical baths - iteratively pouring...stuff into the pits to eat through layers of grime, metal, and generally make it softer for the diggers to plow through
	- Various slums, homes built into the junkyard
	- [[Rusty's Bootlegger]] - item shop with dubious wares
		- vials of acid (20gp; has 10 in stock) - 2d6 acid damage improvised weapon attack
		- Potions - slight upcharge
			- 75gp 2d4+2 (normal) (5 in stock)
			- 400 for greater (3 in stock)
		- **Rusty's Razorwire**: A tarnished ring made from razorwire, granting the wearer a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with piercing/slashing melee attacks. However, the ring's rusty and sharp condition deals 1d4 piercing damage to the wearer whenever the user deals damage.
		- **Scrapheap Shield**: A shield made from a piece of scrap metal, granting the wielder a +2 bonus to Armor Class. However, the shield's makeshift construction means it will shatter on a critical hit. Alt - the user can use a bonus action to make an attack with the shield (STR based for 1d4 + str damage).
		- **Gearhive Gauntlets** (att): A pair of gauntlets made from interlocking gears, granting the wearer a +1 bonus to Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) checks and the ability to climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings. (Rare)
### Sailing Away Aides
> Some sort of hint towards Shoals' wareabouts

Not really a harbor area on [[Delver]], but asking around could yield some hits on navigators/hired hands:
1. [[Tigyn Sidara]] - a wood elf female pirate who's familiar with the [[Havangart]]an Triangle (waters around [[Corosiva]],[[Machivelia]], and [[Khiage]]).
	1. Actively looking to get back to [[Khiage]], specifically [[Cenote Bay]]
	2. Willing to help for free
	3. Dodgy about why she's here alone w/o a ship and crew. Trust building could reveal that she was marooned on a nearby island after attempting to lead a mutiny against the first-mate (unfair rations, unfair loot distribution, not relaying concerns to the captain)
2. [[Dr. Nataniel Cordario]] - academic human man, manning a small ship (could support the party but is tight on space).
	1. Originally from [[Machivelia]] currently on sabbatical from Universary Athenae in [[Pythinia]].
	2. Comfortable navigating to Machivelia and [[Havangart]] in his own vessel ([[The Semi-Dipper]]), but wouldn't go near [[Khiage]] per lack of Danger Comp/insurance funding
3. [[Privateer Pell Peppercorn]] - a Jerbeen (small mouse!). She is a former captain of a very small vessel, but ran into some nefarious actors around [[Havangart]]. 
	1. She tried breaking through the siege/trade barricade at night only to suffer substantial damage to her ship and reputation. She managed to get back to [[Corosiva]] for some repairs, but sold her ship as scrap about a week or two ago.
	2. Mostly been taking one-off jobs ferrying supplies around the islands on [[Arthur Tennyson]]'s payroll, he's got money and she needs to save up to make a down payment on a new ship.

## Traveling to Rusted Keys
- day 1: good! without issue
- day 2: good! 0.75 days travel + 0.25 at nice
- day 3: they find [[Privateer Pell Peppercorn]]!
	- She saw something/(Dr Shoals) "fly" in to [[Pontecita]], party has yet to realize this and ask about it
	- 

### Encounters
- **Negative**
	- Ambushed at night by a set of Kua-toa
		- 2 bulky guards (use Sea Lion stats); wielding heavy spears
	- Lightning Weird tears through the sails on a DC15 perception check failure
		- Smells like ozone too
- **Neutral**
	- Shipwrecked individual, pigeon-folk (Luma race), ~20s, named: Pirio. Caught up in a spat between pirates and some bardic troupe from [[Havangart]].
		- Pirio's ship was traveling from [[Ruddy Rock]] up towards [[Corsair's Cove]] on a diplomatic mission, information gathering affair on behalf of [[The Parliament]].
		- Likely drifted for the better part of a day - conflict was in the north west.
	- Sea monsters?
		- Young Mercury dragon named Hydrargio playing in the waters, if they can be detected.
- **Positive**
	- Friendly merchant vessel - a small schooner led by [[Skipper Caraway]] (typical pirate accent) likely from [[Flintpoint Harbor]] in [[Havangart]].
		- See his bio for inventory/wares
	- Glint of the sun catches a glint of gold at the bottom of the Azure waters of the [[Eternal Sea]]
		- It's a little shallower here - you may be able to get to whatever is down there...
		- Scattered coins totaling 1d4 x 50gp
			- Somewhat buried in the muck req. a DC17 strength check but also: The Ship's Wheel of the Surefooted - of [[Linnæsa]]n design, if installed at a drydocks, grants a ship +1 to survival/navigational checks 
			- Disturbing the wheel in the muck --> Mudmaw/animated quicksand-type encounter: https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/mudmaw
			- Getting hit underwater: Conc. check or lose 1 puff of air
				- Number of puffs are: 1+Con Mod; (min 1); various 5e rules for holding breathe.
