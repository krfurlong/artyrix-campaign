<hr>

## Recap points
- Party fought the Bandersniff (Top-Dog), and destroyed the core functions in the [[Domain of Dogs]]
	- Aided by a crew of recruits - almost all of who died in the fighting
	- Party learned more about the bandersniff's history, and some of the recent communications this creature seemingly had with the outside world (including [[Osiris Siltguard]])
	- [[Bugsy]] fails vs Jackalwere curse
	- Start with [[Krystabald]] identifying the vials of blood (req. roll for success)
## Intro
Beaten and battered from your foray into the [[Domain of Dogs]], your party emerges victorious - much to the excitement of [[Quzy Akone]] who cheers as you exit, his cries shifting to muffled sobs at seeing how few of his followers accompanied you out as you exited the gates. Wordlessly, he rushes over to Bofur and Tofur, the dwarves, badly bloodied as they are, and scoops an arm underneath both to help them remain upright. "Rest" he speaks softly to you - Kryst - before continuing: "I'll meet you all in the morning; I'm sure there are more than a few pitched tents available for you all."

### Identifying the vials
Back at the tents, you all gather around [[Krystabald]] as he begin tracing out a series of runic glyphs in the charcoal colored floor neath your feet - the glow from a nearby crackling fire casting light and dancing shadows from underneath all of your faces. Kryst, you finish tracing the last Glyph and with a tug on your glove, a rush of information floods to your senses - as if it had always been on the tip of your tongue: 
Crimson vial
> "Blood: Drawn from the mortal from of a creature not one week prior. The character of the blood had begun to erode - yet a dark essence beyond which anything you've ever encountered before almost radiates from the vial. An affliction - uncurable by almost all means short of divine intervention - of that you are sure, and one that would surely transform the afflicted into a beast unrecognizable to that of their former self."

Bright red/yellow streaked vial (what Bugsy had)
> "Blood: Drawn from the mortal from of a creature perhaps 2 weeks hence. The blood itself is thin, which only draws your attention to the clear curse that is encapsulated within it. While lycanthropic in nature, the severity of this malady is somewhat muted, as if a less potent - but still very real and present. It may be cured via spiritual processes or via rare but not unheard of medicinal means. If left untreated, the curse will progressively overwhelm the host **(1hr per day on a failed DC10 wisdom save.)** until they lose full knowledge of the person they used to be.
### Dreams that night
[[Sybil]] vs [[Bugsy]] potentially?

## Next options
- Continue downward?
	- Assuming the group will head straight to level 5 in [[The Endless Pits]]
		- [[Wonderland Weirdness]]
- Sailing up to...[[Khiage]] per tips for [[Kailani]]'s brother?
- Sailing to [[Havangart]] to look into a passage to Level 5 of the pits (e.g.,  [[The Looking Glass]])
