Title: Salt in the Wound
<hr>

## Recap
Party saved Remus from falling to his death in the Duel against [[Arthur Tennyson]]. They escaped and by luck happened across [[Underscrew]] where they successfully navigated and assuaged the fears of the dock-guards/wardens that they meant no harm, in part by gaining concurrence from Kryst's brother [[Quzy Akone]] (Zeeq)

> The light of the midday sun reflects and refracts through barely visible cracks in the stones and cliffs that largely guard and hide the harbor in which you all now are assembled, casting odd shadows only broken by bright streaks of sunlight. Kryst - upon learning of your brother's whereabouts, and potential sway within whatever community you've stumbled upon - time seems to slow down ever so slightly as memories of your brother rush back to you...and yet, it's been so long since you've connected, fully spoken plainly and honestly with other another...who is he now, and what sort of long-con is he in the midst of pursuing now?
## Learning to Sail from Osiris
> The harbor on the outskirts of [[Underscrew]] is rather small so [[Aoife]], you quickly find your way over to the ship that was pointed out to you by [[Urz Prag]]. Two docks down, a medium sized, sleek, dark-wooded vessel bearing the name of [[The Fifth]] looms before you - it's pale grey sails making for a very monochromatic vibe. In keeping with this theme, a pale gray skinned man, likely of elven heritage, stands at the stern of the ship - facing the long tunnel heading towards Underscrew proper and thus, clocking you immediately as you begin moving closer. They break from the traditional mariners or sailors attire in that they wear predominately dark leathers, and carry a tome bearing unfamiliar sigils and symbols strapped to their hip. As you draw near, they deftly swing themselves over the back of their ship, swiftly falling the 10 feet down to the docks before landing with hardly a sound. 
> 
>"I thought I heard my name dropped by Urz...funny how the lack of sound afforded to us by the privacy makes any noise we make immediately less discrete -  pleasure to meet you. My name is [[Osiris Siltguard]] - and this is my ship, [[The Fifth]]. To whom am I address and how may I be of interest to you?"
### Sailing Test
To gain proficiency with aquatic vehicles, [[Aoife]] must finalize some pieces of knowledge beneficial to supplement her applied experience. [[Osiris Siltguard]] uses a ghastly version of minor illusion throughout the "trials" to illustrate some of these concepts.

Questions - Each successful answer grants Adv on the next **Wisdom/Intelligence check (DC15)**:
1. When casting off on a voyage, what is the best time to start your journey and set off on the high seas? 
   A: Night/Morning with the tides; With the help of the winds; when fair weather be in the forecast
2. You find yourself stuck on one side of a bay of shallow water marked by coral reefs. How do you sail through it?
   A: Use a pole to gauge the depth of the water from the bow; Wait for calm flat seas and no wind; Drop sails and row through on oars, or in larger vessels use sweeps or sculling oars.
3. If you're trying to flee a site or foe, should ye sail in the windward direction or in the leeward direction - assume you've got a third Spinnaker mast assisting you in your travels.
   A: Leeward (that's with the wind)
### Maritime Gossip
- Recent scuffles between some sailors and the artist-merchants on [[Havangart]]. Allegedly there were some rumors they sold a bad batch of drugs that they were then loathe to admit, lest it ruin their reputation - likely out of [[Rifterra]].
- Dredging activities in the south of [[Khiage]] seems like they're building something - perhaps intending on extending a trainline out as to not be so dependent on the Eternal Sea
- A monastery in the north-western region of [[LinnÃ¦sa]] once known for their pacifist and therapeutic techniques suddenly turned aggressive. Reports of highly skilled mariners traversing the seas and single-handedly sinking ships without reason piled in a few months ago but have since slowed up.
	- **Kai's brother did indeed attempt to parlay with [[Osiris Siltguard]] and his crew, but his true intentions were found - he was marooned, otherwise unharmed, because of this somewhere in [[The Northern Barrier Islands]].**
	- Osiris did not kill Kai's father, not was he engaged in the attack on the monastery. 
3. Stone Giant (https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/stone-giant-dreamwalker) living/working in [[Underscrew]], [[Physiro]]. Potentially has some fomorian blood in him.
## Exploring Underscrew
### Intro
Making you way into the landmass itself from the small harbor, you quickly pass into a concealed, perhaps 25 feet across tunnel, a stream of water running along side you into the space before you, however, takes up roughly half of the ground - leading most of you to follow in either single-file or 2 by 2. It is dank in the underground passage, though not an earthy or swampy dankness but rather one that carries a bit of metallic sharpness that cuts through the otherwise humid and stuffy interior. After following the tunnel perhaps 20 minutes, the walking path  gives way entirely to the stream, and you're led to board a set of well-worn but dependable looking longboats beached along the side of the path. 

Following the stream inward even further, bits of moss and dirt give way at times, revealing a metallic wall - a stark reminder that the space in which you are and upon which [[Faciv]] is built is not organic but rather very much constructed and mechanical. 10 minutes later, the passage opens up around you and you find yourselves in a large chasm of a space, featuring simple wooden buildings and fishing shacks built either stilts on the water itself or nestled precariously on the side of the walls of the cavern. Wooden footpaths and simple bridges connect these buildings, all gently lit by the warm soft glow of hundreds of low burning torches and lanterns, which in turn reflect the blue-light of the water underneath filling the entire space with pale blue. 
- "So, let me be the first to officially welcome you all to [[Underscrew]]" Urz states as they take a small nod and gesture from the bow of their longboat.
### Underscrew Places
1. The Rake: at the harbor on the outskirts of Underscrew, [[Urz Prag]] manages both the dockside concerns, concealment, and sales at a sizable Rake. Current items for sale include:
	1. Explosives, (1d10-3d10 fire)
	2. Ship munitions/upgrades
	3. Coral Barbs (used like spike strips to deter/slow/break down) pursuing ships at sea
2. The Siphon (farm): a subterranean farm that uses a Sphere of Annihilation and mirrors to catch/capture light that glints off the water, then uses that light later to farm
	1. **Quest**: [[Creatures from the Deep]] 
	2. Owner: Tellurah Silverskin (triton)
3. The Anchor (Bar):, the only tavern in [[Underscrew]]
   > Stepping inside the Anchor, you quickly note the stilts on which the bar sits are visible from the interior of the bar too - as the bar itself seems to be built in a ring-like shape, featuring a well of sorts in the middle of the bar that looks down roughly 10 feet to the slowly slopping water below. Soft torchlight fills the space and a din of quiet conversation hushes to almost silence as you step inside as the maybe dozen figures inside turn to clock your arrival and size you up. After a beat or so though, a squat Hedge (hedgehog) resumes the ditty she was composing on her harmonica which seems to set the bar at ease. The bartender across the way - a female dark skinned elf - looks deep in conversation with a cloaked figure seated on the far perimeter, near the bar, though the barkeep notes your crews arrival and gestures haphazardly as if to say - sit yourselves anywhere and I'll be around in a moment.
   - NPCs: 
	1. Owned by a female drow named [[Celessaryn Murkshire]], an advocate for those living below [[Faciv]] and partially responsible for the upward mobility of the crew in recent years.

	4. "Clicker" - insect-like creature (Thri-Kreen) that fell from the sky and only commutes via empath emotions, clicks.

		2. Generally scared about where they are now and when they'll be able to reunite with their kind
		3. Harboring some feelings of superiority, their kind likely views themselves as conquerors of the cosmos
