Title: The Forsaken Isle
<hr>

## Recap
- Bugsy curse save: Counter is at **6 (out of 24)**
	- **Wis save 11 required each time he falls asleep**
- Party broke through the siege but lost one of the ships in the armada in the process ([[Cursed Cacti]] literally blew up)
	- Drifted into the harbor at [[Rifterra]] battered but not direly damaged
	- Explosion did draw the attention of the larger siege fleet...
## Intro
As your sloop drifts into one of the _many_ open bays of the expansive harbor of [[Rifterra]], you find yourselves caught between two sources of activity: The larger ships in your fleet (e.g., everyone else: [[Nymphsong]], [[Libra Shackleton]], and [[Maelstrom's Fury]]) forced to throw anchors down slightly off the harbor, you already see longboats being lowered into the water from each - taking off quickly to your position on the docks. 

On the mainland, dimmed torches and shuttered lanterns begin appearing: slowly at first, but then with quickening frequency as the city grows alerted to the arrival of newcomers. In the eerie pale moonlight, a single nearly completely shuttered lantern gets the jump on each of these groups as it emerges from a small structure on the end of the long harbor, illuminating the a outline of a gaunt figure cautiously making their way towards your vessel.

Speaking (Tabaxi man and effectively mayor of Rifterra: [[Absynian Lapwater]], uniform tan coat except for white fur around his mouth giving the impression of a white goatee)
Wearing a gray, tattered cloak - hood pulled up over their face
> _Bonjour and bon nuit_ - I do not recognize your ship ... speak quickly and truly or I'll blow you and your pithy ship to smithereens. Who are you, from where do you sail, and to whom do your allegiances lie?
> Ami - I would advise you towards honesty and expedience: you are in no position to be dodgy and I am in position to risk the lives of my people for a stranger who got lost.
### Some details on the siege and [[Rifterra]]
- No friendly ship has docked in the past 6 weeks - Absynian all but assumed the outside world had forgotten or given up on them
	- Siege came on quietly with multiple [[The Reinvention]] ships docking and blocking commerce - seemed more like a nuisance at first
	- Then people started disappearing, getting asked weird questions about the drug trade that locals were happy to answer at first and only grew skeptical and suspicious too late
	- ~3 weeks ago, Sigmis Poppycock (gnome, deputy mayor) decided to row out and try to parlay/negotiate with them - he came back...harrowed (**Under a geas spell: fears any non-Reinvention member. Driven to walk into the sea.**)
- 2 forced landings have been attempted by the siege folks to try and take the city and make it bend - these actions forced Absynian to raise a small militia of local artfolk, stranded merchants, and untrained warehouse foremen.
	- The second landing was larger but they were prepared: had oiled/greased the docks beforehand and literally set fire to ~30% of the harbor to push the invaders back. 
- Across the island:
	- Food is in very short supply in [[Rifterra]], maybe 2 weeks left
	- Food shipments were coming in from the south - the farms around [[Hilltop Observatory]] but they dried up maybe 2 weeks ago
		- People have gone to investigate but haven't come back...
		- Fungi shipments from [[The Fermenti Caverns]] stopped almost immediately, including on the interior routes

## [[Rifterra]] description
As you wake up to the sun filtered through a grey fog, splintering dull light around every corner: you all are able to appreciate the city in more detail. The city of Rifterra - or at least the areas visible to you from the slight fog that settled around the city blocks - was charming, particularly for a mercantile hub of trade this side of the Eternal Sea. Exposed wooden beams against otherwise wooden or even plaster homes gave the houses around a Tudor-esque feel to them - if the Tudor or Elizabethan style existed of course. Looking down the alleyway, street murals and bright, colorful displays of mixed arts filled the spaces between warehouses, taverns, and performance spaces with their own unique charm and character. The skyline visible from your rooms was relatively lowlying and flat - only broken up by the periodic towering wooden cranes - most positioned nearby the docks with large pulleys: arcane and otherwise - to shlep goods and products quickly away from incoming trade vessels during normal times.

These are not normal times - however - and the harbor remains unchanged from when you arrived late last night, save the disappearance of  the rest of  [[The New Transit]] Armada which had accompanied you here just that night before. Contract fulfilled, they seemed to have moved on with their tasks - as your group may be poised to do this day as well...

## Rifterra Regions

1. The Porteaux: Port and harbor district
	1. [[Absynian Lapwater]], the mayor of [[Rifterra]] resides in this district among the larger and more fortified dock-side collection houses
	2. Tavern: [[The Drunken Sailor]] owned by the maiden Pricilla de Mar, human woman from [[Khiage]], [[Corsair's Cove]] specifically
		1. Roudy and appealing to the traders, generally lacking character found otherwise in [[Havangart]]
	3. Performance spaces:
		1. The Drydocks Amphitheater - a forum area overlooking the harbor with built-in amplification, specifically for performing for vessels incoming
		2. The Teatro Franco - a lowly raised stage built between the Porteaux and the Market in the Round district - generally viewed as a stepping stone for larger venues
	4. Questline:
		1. Sigmis is holed up, effectively barricaded in [[The Drunken Sailor]] and has been for weeks. The owner, Pricilla, has moved beyond concern for Sigmis and worries for her own safety, despite being compensated by [[Absynian Lapwater]].
		2. Get him out, don't hurt him too badly, and coordinate with the authorities to figure out what to do with him
2. Market in the Round
	1. [[Brenthiella Dolbera]] - half-elven female and coordinator of the arts in [[Rifterra]] (e.g., unelected co-mayor) has a quasi-administrative building/residence here
		1. Artist colony (the Minaret)- 4/5 level abode above and below ground where rooms have been rented out (a la Paris)
			1. Free to stay but you must create/leave something of your craft behind
		2. generally no gigs are getting booked, although small ditties and informal performances are ongoing, spur of the moment things
		3. Brenthiella is generally distraught, thin and gaunt figured. an discrete delivery of food is passed to her during a conversation and she immediately passes it out to those staying with her.
	2. Circular globe theater-esque building dominates most of this district
		1. Culture Colosseum: on a good day, farmers market vibes with dozens of artisans from across Artyrix - nowadays, maybe 2
			1. Dwarven man, Eoric Faultline- somewhat crazed - with island-based inventions and bobbles, claims he was deserted in [[The Northern Barrier Islands]] for nearly a decade
				1. Coconut of Endless Water (e.g., decanter) - 2500gp
				2. Palm Frond of the Deep Well (shruiken-style, frost-brand dagger), 6000gp (att)
				3. Mote of the Northlands - (att), 1/day cast Blink spell as a bonus action.
			2. Teggimundias Dirtbottom (snerfneblin female, goes by Teggi), worked in [[The Fermenti Caverns]] before getting kicked out/fleeing before the deeper residing folk started hunkering down 
				1. selling the last remains of some mushrooms (roughly 6 weeks old and most rotten by now)
				2. 1 day of rations for 5 people remain: 50 gold pieces, or a way off the island immediately
				3. 2 types of drugs, 1-2 uses each
3. Inner Wharf districts: an expansive set of connected and disparate warehouses, typically the lifeblood of the city and center of activities, these regions are eerily quiet and boarded up as a result of the siege
	1. Wharf NE: Waterside region actually subjected to some periodic cannon fire/bombardment
		1. neighborhood Folk hero-esque figure here is a ~19 year old tiefling (light blue) named Tides (male). actively working on fortifying walls and ensuring old ones  get repaired
		2. Seeking support (supplies, rocks, fortifications) from a boarded up warehouse - unsure what all the mayor is hiding in SW...
	2. Wharf SE: center of the arcane crane managers
		1. Epsilox Surrelmo - gold dragonborn wizard with ties to [[Hilltop Observatory]] where he trained before apprenticing here.
		2. Handful of other mages including Bestus, Psimetria, Ominio (all mixed races, elven/halfling/human)
			1. Bestus in the midst of transporting some wares from the harbor district but then he loses concentration due to exhaustion - crushing blow unless party intervenes to save person in Wharf NE...(Leonar, middle aged painter and sailor)
	3. Wharf Southwest: multiple connected warehouses here are boarded up...
		1. Outbreak of Reinvention zombies fill these spaces - quarantined
			1. Supplies are in here for those willing to face the horde...including a large shipment of non-perishable food (hardtack, some preserved/pickled vegetables) - could support the city for another 1.5 weeks likely, or longer if rationed
		2. Thieves Guild set up underneath the primary warehouse and has slowly been tapping into this resource - node of [[The Stallignment]]
			1. Led by a werewolf dwarf, Parylox Cavernborne - who's cunning but growing impatient of being stuck on island for so long...
4. Ars Venundarte
	1. Taverns and performance spaces abound but many are closed up
	2. Taverns include 
		1. The Primed Canvas
		2. The Inkwell - (more sophisticated, caligraphy vibes)
		3. The Discordant Dragon - musical tavern with boisterous performance room underneath the main level
		4. Maybe a dozen other closed up

## Road to [[Havangart]]
~16 hour journey
 Risks known:
 - Swampy
 unknown risks: sunken zombies...

> Following the Eastern road out of the city, you all are struck by how quickly the dense buildings fade away to wilderness as soon as you leave the range of the large shipment cranes. Well-paved for a period of time as you walk past small farms and homesteads - all picked clean and apparently deserted, looking ahead you already perceive things will get more rustic and dusty in the next hour or so. 

- Doing anything on the way there? 
### Encounter
- 2 zombie warriors
- 2 ghoul wolves
- 1 gray thirster
- 1 Flameblade crusader (reskinned to necrotic blade)

### Obstacles
1. Trekking through the increasingly swampy lands - unless otherwise accounted for, everyone needs to make either a strength save or Con save DC13 or suffer 1 point of exhaustion
2. Stealthing around [[The Fermenti Caverns]] encampment (DC15 stealth)
	1. A small army of forces from [[The Reinvention]] have gathered around the caverns, intended to smoke them out and force their hand at cooperation - they've been gathered there for about 5 weeks at this point.
	2. The surrounding area is largely void of life - being drained dry by the undead presence of these forces - the think underbrush and folliage of the boggy marshlands is almost entirely flaked away, greens have faded to greys and browns and even the water seems to have a brackish, sickly color to it.
3. Noxious and explosive mushroom patch
	1. Carefully tread through it: DC14 dex or suffer 3d6 poison damage
	2. Trim/cut back: DC12 Nature
	3. Loose the spores to deactivate the danger: DC16 dex or suffer 4d6 fire from the explosion, half on save

## Sealine travels to [[Havangart]]
- half-day journey under fair conditions and unimpeded
- Risks known:
- Combat options
	- Boarding ships from [[The Reinvention]], smaller ships but more numbered
		- 3 vessels of 3:
			- 2 brine zombies
			- 1 Sturdy brute
	-

> The coastline of [[Havangart]] seems just as worn down and distraught as the people of the isle. Not soon after departing the harbor, a noxious smell struck you - rotting fish. You quickly note the shores of the island were covered with a thick layer of fish of every shape and size, uneaten and decaying - something on these seas is amiss.
> 	Kai - upon seeing this, you feel a pang of...something. of someone - sympathy and distraught hit you first before these feelings are pushed away by some other force within you - anger, rage, a keen desire to exact revenge...
> 	(the fish in the area have been poisoned by a necrotic draught, based on a substance commonly used in curing/salting in [[Dynistia]] but that is toxic in higher doses, effectively a form of dust of dryness.)

## Arriving in [[Simulcepio]]
>With the smell of unnatural decay behind you now, you're met with a more expected smell of the fecund. 



## Conclusion
Party is camping in the marshland en route to [[The Fermenti Caverns]]
- Need to resolve [[Bugsy]]
- Need to resolve resting and watches
