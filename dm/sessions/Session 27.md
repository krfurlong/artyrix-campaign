Title: Finding Fermenti - Failing Fast
<hr>

## Recap
- Bugsy curse save: Counter is at **6 (out of 24)**
	- **Wis save 11 required each time he falls asleep**
- Party worked through the barren city of [[Rifterra]], speaking with [[Absynian Lapwater]]
	- Effectively rescued Sigmis Poppycock, the deputy mayor from fear a la the geas spell
- Started travelling to [[The Fermenti Caverns]] to hopefully alleviate the current famine conditions of the city
	- Intercepted and nearly killed tbh by a patrolling group from [[The Reinvention]].
	- About to rest in the swampy marshland

## Intro
Battered and unexpectedly faced with wounds beyond those that you were maybe expecting, the shadows of the day set upon your group heavily as night quickly draws closer. With another long day of travel likely ahead of you tomorrow, you set yourselves to scouting a place to bed down for the night.

### Resting in the Marshlands
1. **Question**: where do you want to be making camp? On/off the path - if so how far etc.
2. DC15 Survival check to find a suitable campsite. Consumables and other contributions raise/lower the DC appropriately.
	1. If high, you find a small cluster of trees tucked on some comparatively higher ground. Surrounded by these trees and a cluster of knotty vines and shrubs, you feel dry enough that you'll sleep restfully
	2. You spend about an hour scouring about the area with limited success. You eventually come across a cluster of large fallen trees - allowing you to at least partially set yourselves out of the muck and grime for the evening.
		1. Penalty: DC13 Con save or fall to 1 pt of Exhaustion (or not recover 1 point)
3. Bugsy - **Make your wisdom saving throw**.
4. Checks:
	1. first watch: a druid rogue/scout from [[The Reinvention]] stealths up to the party. He is a halfling, with sunken eyes, thinning brown hair, wearing dark studded leather armor - named Wesley Liltrodden. DC18 Perception to detect his presence
	2. second watch: Wesley summons 4 Vine Blights that begin to constrict the resting party members - DC14 perception
		1. If they're lopped off, they begin to recede and the rogue may be forced to haul one of the party members away via wildshape
	3. third watch: fungi have began to grow around your group - a lot of mushrooms all feint light blue in color are clustered around your resting party - **DC14 Perception**
		1. Noticing details: they're growing around the faces of each person resting - oddly clustered around them to be honest
		2. If left undetected, each one "casts" sleep at 2nd level (7d8) before the full benefits of the rest are gained.

Watch schedule:
- Aoife
- Sybil
- Kai
### Morning shenanigans
If thwarted, Wesley scampers back to [[The Fermenti Caverns]] leaving behind a set of tracks detectable with a DC15 perception check upon waking up.

If not thwarted, Wesley attacks to kidnap up to 4 members of the party w/ vine blights or 1 member (randomly selected among sleepers in 3rd watch) to take them back to Fermenti - they awake with their hands bound and mouth gagged by vines when they're a ways off from the party (500ft)

Trekking through the increasingly swampy lands - unless otherwise accounted for, everyone needs to make either a strength save or Con save DC13 or suffer 1 point of exhaustion

If moving quickly in pursuit of Wesley, DC10 perception to follow the trail and DC16 Con save or suffer 1 point of exhaustion.
## Arriving at [[The Fermenti Caverns]]
After roughly 1 hour of travel carving through the wet marshlands, you collectively begin to notice the foliage and fauna around you beginning to taken on increasingly grey tones - or disappear altogether. Tree stumps (Freshly hewn within 3 days) begin becoming more commonplace than living trees - and the marshy forest before you interestingly seems to open up to the sunlight *more* - letting more light in out of the sheer lack of trees providing shade and cover to the area. The ground begins firming up - yet a sharp smell of decay and infection remains and intensifies as you travel onward. 

> DC14 Perception check: you begin to hear the slightly muted rustles and din of voices. *Hundreds of voices* and the clinks of what you discern are countless pieces of metal (armor, weapons).

The path picks up in earnest here as it almost emerges from the swamp as a wooden planked bridge/walkway leading towards the Caverns.
	[[Aoife]], as you near this walkway, you recall seeing and being here in the past - and you know that you're likely 5 minutes and one rolling hill away from being at Fermenti.
	
As you crest over the small knoll, you see before you in the lowlands what appears to be effectively a makeshift camp for a small army. Groups of 5-6 tents are clustered around fire pits that flank the wooden walkway leading through camp and ending at an enormous and surprisingly still standing willow tree. The roots of the tree at its base stand larger than a fully grown orc -  and are spaced out enough to theoretically allow a dozen individuals to rest comfortably under the tree - if it weren't for the deep hole that you, Aoife, know exists within - marking the sole point of entry and exit to the [[The Fermenti Caverns]]. 

Peppered throughout the lowlands surrounding the Caverns is the banner of [[The Reinvention]]. If there was ever any doubt who was conducting this raid and siege, it is gone now.

1. Stealthing around [[The Fermenti Caverns]] encampment is possible at this point. (DC15 stealth)
	1. Retreating and swinging extra wide to avoid the stealth check is okay but requires a Con save through the swamp (DC13 or +1 exhaustion)
	2. A small army of forces from [[The Reinvention]] have gathered around the caverns, intended to smoke them out and force their hand at cooperation - they've been gathered there for about 5 weeks at this point.
2. Fighting? Don't even think about it.
	1. 20 groups of 5-6 people each.

## Sigil drawing
- [[Kailani]]'s marking is a 14 to perceive
- [[Bugsy]]'s is a 15
- [[Aoife]] is a 25
- [[Sybil]] is a 23
- [[Krystabald]] got a 28


### NPCs around the Lowlands [[The Fermenti Caverns]] 

Below details the rough heirarchy of [[The Reinvention]]:
1. [[Jasad Peatmire]] is within the deepest layer of the Caverns - actively trying persuade [[The Painted Turtles]] passage
2. [[Tau-0]] (naught) a malfunctioning automaton from [[Delta Prime]], Algorith stats
		1. seeking destruction and creation in one foul swoop
	1. Surrounded by a cadre of 8 Elemental Defenders - thunder and lightning damage oriented
	2. Positioned alongside the Great Willow
3. [[Osiris Siltguard]] - leading logistics aboveground with members of his crew

## Exploring [[The Fermenti Caverns]]

1. Mouth of the cavern under the Great Willow
	1. Passing through the mouth of the cavern undetected is near impossible...DC25 stealth check would need to get passed.
	2. Guarded by [[Osiris Siltguard]] who guides activities of the Lowlands from a tent.
		1. 6 brine zombies wait nearby
		2. 1 wolf trainer
		3. 4 Githyanki warrior statted pirates
		4. 1 chaos blade 
	3. Other groups of warriors are nearby - join the combat 2 rounds after they are alerted
2. Level 1 of the Caverns is the "smallest" as it widens up as you descend
	1. The shrooms growing here are highly cultivated and represent most of the edible and nutritious shrooms on the island
	2. The farms are expansive as high tunnels seem to stretch in every direction, The area is not unlike that first level of [[The Endless Pits]] that you traversed weeks ago
		1. The farms here are overgrown, and the shrooms themselves are beginning to overgrow the walls and ceiling on which they grow to close off tunnels completely
	3. [[Dustgore Emberplate]] from the [[The Reinvention]] is the leader in charge on this level (rhino-person, from [[The Crash]])
		1. Generally just drives a plow through a nearby plot of land to feed the living members of the army
		2. Food from this level could likely support [[Rifterra]] for 3 weeks without additional farming...
	4. A single famer - a gnome girl in early 20s named [[Niamh Sporetoes]]  is held as a prisoner in the area by Dustgore, to replant the shrooms he carves up
3. Level 2: The mushrooms and fungi get more wild on this level - and it's less tunnels and more a collection of underwater pools
	1. Most fungi are farmed for drugs on this level - with moderate effects/perks
	2. DC16 Perception: it appears that small samples are taken from almost every unique area of this level
		1. Peatmire was searching for the substance that enabled him to commune with his father in the beyond
		2. Periodically, bodies of members from [[The Reinvention]] are scattered, sprawled out. 70% are alive and high out of their minds, 30% are dead of multiple causes
			1. Maybe 30 dead all bearing the brand on the base of their skull
	3. duergar named Verik Turnstone (Einherjar stats) is the main POC on this level
		1. He's just recently recovered from his trip
		2. 4 others - (githyanki warrior stats) lay nearby and are generally just on patrol
4. Level 3: The deep Caverns where the prized mushroom grows
	1. [[The Painted Turtles]] are holed up in here - they've overgrown the passage that leads to the most prized corner of the cavern where the most valued shrooms grow
	2. Myconids are common around here as well - although they're currently staying with the painted turtles
	3. [[Jasad Peatmire]] has a camp here as well - surrounded by some of his most trusted men and some undead beserkers who are just constantly slashing at the mushroom barrier.
		1. Bodies of exhausted/scorched undead lie in an ever growing heap - maybe 40 bodies deep


## Conclusion
- Sybil and Bugsy are in the mouth of [[The Fermenti Caverns]]
- Panther is tracking Aoife and Kryst above ground
- Kai is also waiting above ground (is hidden/stealth)
- Osiris: Do we want to do this the easy way or the hard way? ...to
