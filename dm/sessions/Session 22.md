## Recap Points
- Bugsy curse save: Counter is at 4 (out of 24)
	- **Wis save 10 required each time he falls asleep**
- The group continued to poke around [[Rusted Keys]] - spending the evening in the Red Lantern district where they attended a show at the Experience Emporium
	- Drugs were had by some, and the group pursued a group of pirate-folk from the shit [[The Torment]] to a cove outside of town
	- Sneaky rolls avoided a conflict here - huzzah! Bugsy investigated most of it
- Lord Maris communicates back to [[Aoife]] on behalf of her parents, confirming they are alive but indeed under threat from the siege

## Ways to [[Havangart]]

1. Sail about their own vessel w/o coordination
 This would result in some sort of encounter with [[The Reinvention]] 
  
2. Stealth options
Go stowaway on the vessel currently at The Dusty Docks and requiring repairs. This would likely delay the departure of [[Rusted Keys]] by a number of days (3 more)

Steal the colors of [[The Black Phoenix]]
