Title: **A Cure for a Curse** 
<hr>

> As you all stumble quickly awake on your somewhat cramped sailing vessel to the realization that you must have accidentally turned course at some point since setting off, you also grapple with the large dark hulled vessel looming behind you. With multiple dark ebony sails with the only distinguishing characteristic being streaks of bright, electric blue painted on the main 45degree diagonal of each sail - giving it almost the appearance of a bird of prey - cutting through the water and soaring towards your comparatively tiny ship. Complicating your morning even further, you awake to find your companion - Kai - with deeply sunken eyes and a gaunt overall appearance, bearing stark contrast to the person you first met but a few days ago. 

_So...in this tumultuous morning, how do you all proceed?_
## Situation
- [[Miranda Barnibas]] - a half-elven corsair/mercenary/true neutral type is captain of [[The Black Lapis]]
	- Ship currently in moderate disrepair and moving at 80miles per day instead of 120 due to run in with a dragon turtle
	- Crew was actually deep diving around a lair on a tip from someone in [[Rusted Keys]] in [[Khiage]]
		- Seeking scales that they could then pawn off to mechs in [[Corosiva]]
	- They got caught up in a scuffle with one dragon turtle - indications that another is actively pursuing them
- Currently en route to [[Faciv]] to meet their buyer ([[General Lutskyiv]])
	- Each scale is worth approximately 2500gp

cook - aoife (19), bugsy
gunner - kryst (pass!)
bosun - sybil (pass!) 
sails - Kai (23)

[[Nohu]] - Kai's brother. Details imparted to [[Bugsy]]
- Looks like [[Kailani]], but is her brother
- Flying solo - heading towards [[Khiage]]

[[Rabid Company]] - the war group that [[Bugsy]] was in...

### Relevant History
Two groups went under:
- [[Miranda Barnibas]], [[Eilif Talbjorne]], and [[Garth Nooks]] harvested 3 scales at seafloor before stealing a dragon egg
	- Garth is nervous as shit but sworn to secrecy - and he made a special barrel to boot
	- Eilif is more profit motivated, looking forward to making slightly more on this trek
- [[Ocinara Blacktide]], [[Galin Sweetgrass]], [[Arya Silverweb]], and [[Krakenbeard]] went right up to the dragon turtle and pried 2 loose - 
	- Galin also harvested 4 vials of blood - nobody knows except for Galin but they're harboring some guilt
	- Mostly because Arya was killed by the creature as it flailed...

## On Board Activities
1. [[Skye Shadowstep]] is suspicious (rightfully so) of whatever went down in the expedition parties yesterday.
	1. She's a longtime member of the crew, but increasingly wary of Miranda's ambition
	2. Why are they pursuing us like this now?
2. [[Krystabald]] to see a vision and a spark of curiosity if he sees a dragon scale...
	1. [[Zumaj]] to perhaps visit in a recent dream about creating something anew...from a dragon...maybe multiple dragons ðŸ¤”
3. [[Shaman Zlup]] _immediately_ clocks Kai's condition.
	1. They cannot cure it. But they can force a mutation
	2. Mechanically, the curse is replaced with lycathropy (wereshark)
		1. Adapt from these stats: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Wereshark_(5e_Creature)
4. [[Jaxxon Deepclaw]] recognizes Sybil - his family was pushed out of [[Sur'dame]] and lived in [[Tyrfall]] due to rising cost of living in the city
	1. Hints that he might have seen something somewhere about folks looking for her...or maybe just aware that she comes from money...
	2. Aware, suspicious of a bounty posted on her head [[A Lion's Share]] questline. 
5. [[Vex Sparksong]] interested in trying out/finalizing her pod-projectors (2) in case of another run in.
	1. Would require some time/review by others to facilitate use in combats
	2. Small deployment sigil in the railing on the main deck
6. [[Eilif Talbjorne]] and [[Kaida]] have sailed together in the past - each likely has some pointers to help out [[Kailani]]'s pursuit
	1. they've seen the sigil/sign and know roughly its whereabouts (southern [[Khiage]], unaffiliated with [[Corsair's Cove]])
	2. Maybe a name...
7. Ship activities to expedite travel
	1. Esp a sailmaker (since Arya died).
	2. **Skill Challenge** to do this. 
		1. All success --> avoid Dragon Turtle encounter completely
		2. half+ successes --> avoid double Milli health roll (e.g. arrive before midnight)
			1. Req. Dragon Turtle encounter
		3. Less --> Dragon Turtle encounter **and** another roll from Milli

## End of Session
- Draconic Encounter on the horizon - likely within the hour?
