<hr>

## Recap
- Bugsy curse save: Counter is at **5 (out of 24)**
	- **Wis save 10 required each time he falls asleep**
- Party joined up under contract with [[The New Transit]] and interacted with [[Nivo Junctos]]. Currently sailing with a small fleet of 4 other much larger/more decked out vessels to break the siege.
	- Day 1 went by uneventfully - calm seas and minor interactions
	- Day 2 slated to be calm waters

## Kai vision
Sleep finds you all quickly after a long day under the warm sun on the [[Eternal Sea]]. Kai - however - you find that no matter how you toss and turn on the wooden deck of the ship, you are unable to really get comfortable. As you finally feel like maybe _finally_ you're comfortable, you hear a deep, unearthly rumble from beneath you - from coming from deep within the waters below.
- Others who are sleeping appear to have not heard this
- If woken up, their eyes fly open with a pale white light - twisted faces as if they're in pain, recovering from an ailment. Others have a black smoke that seems to seep out of their eyes - looks of panic and fear splayed across their faces

Above deck, the ship continue to move along - keeping pace with the larger ships of the Fleet.
Along each side of your ship, however, you immediate see that something is wrong...or at least different, as you're flanked by 2 impossibly tall dorsal fins emerging from the water around you...

Both entities - speaking as one - rumble the following, directed at you:
	The great spirits of the [[Eternal Sea]] vie for your attention and fealty, [[Kailani]] Kekoa. Though you be only one - and young in your ears - the currents of fate hint that you are destined for great things. To whom or what are your accolades past, present, and future attributed - and if shared by many, are you prepared to be caught in the riptide of their jealousy? 

With this, you feel a slight itching and burning sensation: one

- On one side: **Peahi**, swimming slowly, an ornately speckle-patterned leopard shark that's maybe 60 feet from tip to tail (deep, slow voice) - swimming over shark-spirits of Kai's ancestors, most of who she doesn't recognize but one bears markings of her father (Kaku)
	- I have watched over you ever since you were a mere eddy in the tides. The Kekoa line is dear to me and has been a kind, wise force for good - even in these times of troubled waters. I cannot change what pain has transpired - but I can continue to provide guidance, flexibility, and patience as you move forward and process the chaos and strife through which you have lived. Perseverance and understanding through compassion my tenets - as they are the tenets shared by the Kekoa line for generations before you.
	- **Boon**: Once per combat, roll a DC14 Religion check. On a success, you do not need to roll for your Hands of Healing and the value healed is always maximized for your current dice size.  
- The other side: **Hekili, Sea Avatar of Talos** - a similarly enormous tiger shark, bearing dark streaks against stripes of what looks like pure electric blue light
	- Yours is a new sight for my eyes - and small as you are, you are a guppy before me. I am the rumble of thunder and the gusts of the storm. I am Judgement and Revenge - take upon my mantle and eschew that which has marked you from birth and I can promise you  power to force your foes to bend to your will. To quake beneath your maw and make them fear you - as you should fear me. Together we shall set things right - and return to your family he who you seek.
	- **Boon:** Once per combat, when you make a bonus action BITE attack in your shifted form, your attack deals an additional 2d6 thunder damage and the target must save on a DC14 Strength save or be pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked prone
## Intro for real
Your second day of the voyage from [[Rusted Keys]] to the isle of [[Havangart]] begins much like the first day: smooth waters lapping against the side of _Dat Aft_ cause you all resting to slowly stir awake - at peace but with a sense of cautious anxiety at what lay before you.

[[New Transit - Siege Busters]]

### Connecting with the Crews
Slightly after mid-day, Bugsy - you clock a silver glint fly off of [[Nymphsong]] - Lysandra La Rose's vessel immediately in front of you. It dives towards the ocean waters for a moment before levelling out to coast on the maritime winds directly towards your vessel.
- Silver pseudo-dragon, goes by the name: Umi
- As Lysandra's familiar, she can speak through Umi:
	- We've voyaged for over a day now -  Have you no means of truly conversing?
		- What seek your party at [[Havangart]]? are you transporting goods and perishables that are in need to quick delivery - why the haste to join our siege breakers?

### Encounter for Day 2:
Scuttling over the surface of the water...you hear it far before you see them...thousands, maybe millions of pale grey crabs clawing and scuttling over one another - consuming likely everything that gets in their way
	1. What do you do?
		the first group of ships pour something overboard - some sort of deterrent - it would appear, as the wave of white ebony colored crabs shifts like a tidal wave away from them and towards your ship...
		12 [Bone Crabs](https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/bone-crab) "board" your ship, begin poking around looking for food. If they perceive it, DC12 - 3 chances, they will eat it all.
	2. Being aggressive towards the crabs --> summons the crabstrocity.
	3. Left to their own devices, the crabs damage all ships: 3d10 hull damage and will consume all food aboard

The party "befriends" the crabstrocity - promising much food at breaking the siege.
