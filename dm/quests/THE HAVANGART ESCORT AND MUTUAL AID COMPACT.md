This most sacred and binding agreement, hereinafter referred to as "The Compact," is entered into on the [insert date] day of [insert month], [insert year], by and between:

collectively referred to as "The Parties."

**ARTICLE I: SAFE PASSAGE**

The Escort Commander agrees to provide escort services to The Passenger, including all companions, servants, and vessels accompanying The Passenger, across The Eternal Sea to the island of Havangart, hereinafter referred to as "The Destination." The Escort Commander shall coordinate and command a fleet of vessels, hereinafter referred to as "The Escort Fleet," to provide safe passage and protection to The Passenger's vessel from the port of departure to The Destination. The Escort Commander shall utilize his authority and influence to ensure the safe and timely arrival of The Passenger's vessel at The Destination, unless unforeseen circumstances, including but not limited to, acts of war, piracy, or supernatural intervention, necessitate alternative arrangements. Standard and accepted maritime boundaries shall dictate the proper jurisdictions of The Destination. While The Escort Fleet shall endeavor to evade or break through anticipated corsair actions surrounding The Destination to facilitate safe docking at a port at the aforementioned Destination, the Escort Fleet's responsibility of ensuring safe passage ceases upon entry of The Destination's Exclusive Economic Zone as dictated by the standard maritime law.

In consideration of the escort services provided by The Escort Commander, The Passenger agrees to pledge full fealty and support to The Escort Commander and their appointed deputy during the course of the voyage. The Passenger shall:

1. Provide military aid and assistance to The Escort Fleet in the event of an attack or threat to The Escort Fleet, its crew, or The Escort Commander's interests.
2. Participate in all activities and endeavors deemed necessary by The Escort Commander for the successful completion of the voyage, including but not limited to, providing intelligence, scouting, and engaging in ship-to-ship combat.
3. Refrain from engaging in any activities that may be deemed detrimental to The Escort Commander's interests, including but not limited to, mutiny, sabotage, or the theft of The Escort Commander's property or the property of The Escort Fleet.
4. Provide The Escort Commander with any and all information, skills, or expertise that may be relevant to the successful completion of the voyage.

**ARTICLE III: COMPENSATION AND REMUNERATION**

The Passenger shall pay to The Escort Commander a sum of 400 gold pieces, hereinafter referred to as "The Escort Fee," prior to embarkation. The Escort Fee shall be non-refundable, unless The Escort Commander fails to provide safe passage to The Destination, in which case The Passenger shall be entitled to a refund of 25% percent of The Escort Fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that The Passenger's vessel is deemed to be a " Hazardous Vessel" as defined in Appendix A, The Escort Commander reserves the right to claim The Passenger's vessel as compensation for the increased risk of escorting said vessel.

**ARTICLE IV: INDEMNIFICATION AND HOLD HARMLESS**

The Passenger agrees to indemnify and hold harmless The Escort Commander, The Escort Fleet, and their respective crews against any and all claims, demands, or liabilities arising from or related to The Passenger's actions or omissions during the course of the voyage. This indemnification shall include, but not be limited to, damages arising from The Passenger's negligence, recklessness, or willful misconduct. In the event of a "Force Majeure" as defined in Appendix B, The Escort Commander may, at their sole discretion, suspend or terminate escort services without liability or penalty.

**ARTICLE V: DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

Any disputes arising from or related to The Compact shall be resolved through binding arbitration, with The Escort Commander serving as the sole arbitrator. The Passenger agrees to abide by The Escort Commander's decisions, which shall be final and binding. In the event of a dispute, The Escort Commander may, at their sole discretion, require The Passenger to pay a "Dispute Resolution Fee" to The New Transit faction, which shall be used to compensate The Escort Fleet for their time and expenses incurred in resolving the dispute. 

**ARTICLE VI: CONFIDENTIALITY**

The Passenger agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all information, including but not limited to, The Escort Commander's business dealings, trade secrets, and personal affairs, that may be disclosed during the course of the voyage. The Passenger shall not disclose any such information to any third party, unless authorized to do so by The Escort Commander in writing.

**ARTICLE VII: TERM AND TERMINATION**

The Compact shall commence on the date of signing and shall continue in effect until The Passenger's vessel has been safely delivered to The Destination. The Compact may be terminated by The Escort Commander at any time, with or without cause, upon written notice to The Passenger. Upon termination, The Passenger shall immediately cease all cooperation with The Escort Fleet and forfeit any and all claims to The Escort Fee.

**ARTICLE VIII: GOVERNING LAW**

The Compact shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the high seas, as interpreted by The Escort Commander. The Passenger agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of The Escort Commander's courts, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising from or related to The Compact.

**ARTICLE IX: ENTIRE AGREEMENT**

The Compact constitutes the entire agreement between The Parties and supersedes all prior negotiations, understandings, and agreements between The Parties. The Compact may not be amended or modified except in writing signed by both The Parties.
