#quest 

**Premise**: [[Remus Neyender]] (M19, half-elf) is a squire from one of the upper class families. He was assigned somewhat begrudgingly to assist [[Arthur Tennyson]] in his day-to-day activities. At some point, Remus's actions lost Tennyson a valuable piece of digging equipment in [[The Endless Pits]], who had soured on Remus's position as the Neyender's had moved to align themselves with [[General Lutskyiv]]'s bridge operation - as opposed to Tennyson's widely known and adamant position that they must keep digging in [[The Endless Pits]]. Tennyson blew the teen's sarcastic comment out of proportion - and leveraged his position to enact some form of vengeance against the teen and vis-a-vis the Neyender family at large.  
## Background
1. House Neyender is a proud, established clan and well-known among the aristocracy:
	- Father: Rollins Neyender, M45 Human
	- Mother: Faedyn Neyender, F115 sea-elf (Machivelia)
	- Sister: Ruida Neyender, F8 half-elf.
	 
	Rollins followed his father's path (Carlis) in delving into [[The Endless Pits]], managed to strike lucky and then gradually amassed/employed others to do the same. 
	Generally well-regarded/well-respected family not known to taking risks or playing with people's lives

2. **Triggering Event**: a digging crew were exhausted and injured from pushing deeper into the Pits. [[Remus Neyender]] was lieutenant of the troop and was responsive to their need to rest. While resting, [[Arthur Tennyson]] surveilled the apparently "lazy" Remus failing to enforce order and work on the individuals he was paying to dig. Complicating matters, while the digging was paused, a member of the guerilla group, ex-chain gang [[The Lost Change]] (unknown leader is actually [[Quzy Akone]], [[Krystabald]]'s brother; Loosely affiliated with [[Underscrew]]), did a drive by severe injuring 3 members of the digging group and causing some significant - but at that point repairable harm to their digger/equipment. Arthur saw Remus disregard salvaging the machine and instead saw him tending to the men/evacuating them to a safe proximity, leaving the digger to combust.

4. [[Arthur Tennyson]]'s account of the quote was that Remus's actions and negligence _actively_ damaged the equipment (unclear whether he was aware/cared about the drive by). Went on to exclaim the actions were done intentionally, that the digging crew was not that injured, and falsely claimed that Remus was trying to sabotage the dig out of spite and political posturing.
5. Rollins is in position of a light mech suit, effectively an amped up space suit - and plans on giving to Remus for the battle.
		They have been sparring in their court yard for the past week, Rollins hopes it might keep his son alive for a bit longer - some desire to preserve the family honor

### The Reward
One of the following artefacts that have been passed down in the Neyender family
- Piece of refined _Neblinium_ a rare, cosmic metal that catches light and refracts it almost as it was made of crystals. It's light, almost impossibly light, seems imbued with some iridescence, and sharp - the edges of the 2 pound block of refined metal are bound (repeatedly) with cloth
	- If applied to a weapon by a skilled craftsman, grants a +2 bonus and 1d6 radiant damage -
		- And can hit/damage entities in the astral and other interim planes
	- Likely worth ~1k to the right buyer
- The Ring of the Lawkeeper (att): a ring that was owned by an arbiter of justice from long, long ago.
	- Grants a +2 to insight
	- **Vibe Check** (#Proficiency Mod/day): By twisting the ring, you are quickly to get a sense of the general state of affairs in a space/room. Choose up to 3 creatures/entities - as long as you can see them, you can glean their surface level emotions and thoughts (a la detect thoughts). You can "read" all emotions simultaneously and do so without detection.
- Stone of Endurance (att): strange gem extracted from the depths of [[The Endless Pits]]
	- Ignore the effects of the 1st level of exhaustion
- 2 Potions of Diamond Dust: consuming it == casts Revivify
- 2500 gp
