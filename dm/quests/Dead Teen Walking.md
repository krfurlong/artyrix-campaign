**Premise**: [[Remus Neyender]] (M19, half-elf) is a squire from one of the upper class families. He was assigned somewhat begrudgingly to assist [[Arthur Tennyson]] in his day-to-day activities. At some point, Remus mistakenly insulted Tennyson, who had soured on Remus's position as the Neyender's had moved to align themselves with [[General Lutskyiv]]'s bridge operation - as opposed to Tennyson's widely known and adamant position that they must keep digging in [[The Endless Pits]]. Tennyson blew the teen's sarcastic comment out of proportion - and leveraged his position to enact some form of vengeance against the teen and vis-a-vis the Neyender family at large.  
## Background
1. House Neyender is a proud, established clan and well-known among the aristocracy:
	- Father: Rollins Neyender, M45 Human
	- Mother: Faedyn Neyender, F115 sea-elf
	- Sister: Ruida Neyender, F8 half-elf.
	 
	Rollins followed his father's path (Carlis) in delving into [[The Endless Pits]], managed to strike lucky and then gradually amassed/employed others to do the same. 
	Generally well-regarded/well-respected family not known to taking risks or playing with people's lives

2. [[Remus Neyender]] actually said the following to [[Arthur Tennyson]] after another push deeper into the Pits was fruitless/unable to press deeper. Unfortunately, he had forgotten/was unaware in the moment that Tennyson's wife had passed away 5 years prior to the day. 

> Cheer up, my Lord. You're still immensely well off, particularly relative to those under your employ. Lighten up on them - I beseech you. It is not as if your Wife wants for anything! Why, I'm sure a man of your stature and wealth continues to provide the world and more to the one of your eternal affections. 

3. [[Arthur Tennyson]]'s account of the quote was that Remus actively knew of his wife's passing, and targeted particularly cruel words towards him on the day when he was recognizing her passing
4. Rollins is in position of a light mech suit, effectively an amped up space suit - and plans on giving to Remus for the battle.
		They have been sparring in their court yard for the past week, Rollins hopes it might keep his son alive for a bit longer - some desire to preserve the family honor

5. Faedyn has been quietly looking for other options, can't bare to see her son wiped from existence

	- Steal him away before the fight?
		- How/with what?
	- Fake his death during the fight
		- Need to prepare an escape plan and a landing site
	- Beg for forgiveness from Tennyson
		- Where's the honor in that? Reticent to be indebted to the man
	- Find a way to level the playing fields of the fight?
		- Heist to the acid cave mech-garage...
