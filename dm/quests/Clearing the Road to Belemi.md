#quest 

On land journey up towards [[Belemi]]:
The road leading out of [[Rusted Keys]] twists and snakes up the cliffside before finding a narrow pass at which it carves inland. The road itself is well-blazed at first, cutting through a dense jungle - though over time, it does begin to taper and grow less well-trodden and more rugged. At least, this area would have been rugged and barely blazed if it weren't for the wide scar of burnt trees and scorched earth that quickly meets up and travels alongside the road for the first ~5 hours of your journey. 
(vs lava/magmas)
- Magmoid has found a cave-pocket, currently recovering/growing in there
- 2 [Magma Ooze](https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/magma-ooze) are positioned around the opening of the cave with 2 [Lava Children](https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/lava-child-toh) slightly further away from the tunnel opening, Wick and Wreath.
	- The children appear to be ~10 years old around, consider themselves to be siblings (twins) and are just looking to learn more about the world. They become hostile if the magmoid is threatened without finding them a source of life, of fire: [[Sur'incendie]]
		- Active/passive volcanos meet this criteria, maybe in [[Linnæsa]] near [[Packrat]]

Other complication: a deserted member, a rat person named [[Hobbie Seascrub]] of [[The Reinvention]] is spying on the children and believes they can harvested for components to further their cause.

Other complication:
Anchored along the interior bay to the north of [[Rusted Keys]] is a scouting crew of [[The Boastful Barbarian]], a pirate ship affiliated with the [[Briny Armada]] and led by [[Captain Plink Cryptoe]], a large-toed halfling. They were spotted by the lava children, Wick and Wreath - believing them to be spies - are plotting to destroy them after their earlier attempt to capture/restrain them resulted in the death of one of the more junior crewmates, Michlo (human) and the severe burns suffered by Nicola (female human). 

Absent any information, they will presume the party is affiliated with [[The New Transit]] and if the pirates are spotted they will attack:
- 6 squads (each w/ 4 pirates) https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/squad-of-bandits
- Plink Crypto: https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/roving-ruffian
- 1st mate: https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/sir-pelliton (Lady Claire Pelliton), half-elf
