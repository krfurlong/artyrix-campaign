# Hook
[[The Lost Change]] used to be much more active in delving deeper, frequently using the Ethereal Elevator to skip from their base on Level 2 to Level 5 of [[The Endless Pits]]. However, about three weeks ago, the [[Domain of Dogs]] sent an incursion outside of their realm and pilfered the Ethereal Lens, a magical artefact used to bring things from the ethereal plane into existence. 

## Infiltration

>Quest follows a heist-like/lite structure, need to get in and get out with minimal encounters with the dogs. Clearing an area reduces the danger of alerting dogs later on. There's a risk of failing in the final room which could lead to a swarm of clockwork hounds swarming the party in the Vault of Bones.

## Destroying the Domain of Dogs
The region is underpinned by two key components: the Clockwork Hound factory found on node I and the cybernetic laboratory at Node H.
### Destroying the Factory
_Located at Note I_
Combat:
- 2 Clockwork hounds on ground level
- 2 half-strength hounds: one on 2, one on 3.
	- Each has a optical modification to shoot fire bolts/bright blue lasers (2d10 fire damage); disintegrates part of body struck if drops PC to 0 HP
At Initiative ct 20: All elevators move up and down. Conveyer belts move 15 feet forward.
LAIR ACTIONS:
1. Steam blasts from fiery pipes/floor vents (DC14 Dex or 2d6 fire; half on success)
2. Acid pool & ice tube activation: DC14 Con or take 3d6 acid or cold (respectively)
3. Smashers and cutters: DC16 athl or acrobatics check or take 4d6 bludgeoning/slashing
4. Dog Generated: Another clockwork hound is created.

**Factory requires 3 components to be broken to render it inoperable. PC creativity is valued here but some options:**
- Break of the large magnet on L3 (DC20 to hit; 20HP)
- Twist/bend the upper conveyer to dump things into the open pool of magma (DC20 Strength)
- Clog up tubes (DC18 Creativity check)
- Break/stop the Gears from turning (DC22 strength check with some object that feasibly wouldn't break)
- Use the control panel on L3 to do something (DC16 Int)

#### Lore options
Various pieces of paper are scattered around the hidden areas of the factory and in the laboratory that hint at the lead-dog's plight.
##### Hooks to related efforts
- 1 vial (3 uses?) of lycanthropic blood is salvageable in the laboratory
	- Dark crimson in color, with a small piece of twine and gift label bearing a crude illustration of a wolf on 2 legs (warewolf)
- 1 vile (3 uses) of a similar ilk - though it's Jackal blood, and potentially turns individuals into Jackalwares, bright red with streaks of yellow
- Short note addressed to bandersniff- thanking Bandersniff for the trade of a deactivated hound for the vials of blood. **Dated a few weeks ago**
  > Esteemed B. Sniff,
> Enclosed you shall find two vials I believe you shall deem worthy of our exchange. My client continues to voice his admiration at the construct you provided, if you are able to supply more, I'm sure he would be interested in procuring them.
> That said, I know you had voiced some, desires at escaping your current plight. While I do not condone the use of these on any living creature, I care not what you do with them as you've been honest with me and my trading partners up until this point.
> A parting tip, however, from a fellow hunter: lure your prey into a place unfamiliar to them. Perhaps swiping that rumored Ethereal Lens may be a way to draw in those who have tormented and harmed you these past years.
> I'm called by allies across the Eternal Sea - should you need me, I intend to be encircling the small isle of [[Havangart]]. If my memory of  your stories serves me correctly, you've at least seen [[Rifterra]] through the northern windows of the tavern down below in [[The Endless Pits]]. Send word via that channel, if you are able.
> Until we find reason to meet again, Capt. Siltguard ([[Osiris Siltguard]])
##### Poem fragments
1. Three floors up, where where clockwork beasts did dwell,
   There went a curious canine, a bandersniff of smaller stature,
   With bright eyes did venture, his tale to foretell.
   
   On a moonlit night, across a desert's pale glow,
   He encountered a fate, a dread and a woe,
   For clockwork hounds, with ticking precision,
   Captured the pup, with mechanized decision.
   
  2. Within their metallic grasp, he was caged tight, 
    Imprisoned in a lab, a dire plight,
	The gears and springs, his freedom did seize,
	As clockwork canines stood with cold-eyed ease.
   
   But through their ticks, he sensed with dread,
   A purpose for him, went through his head.
   Barking aloud, "I am who I may be,
   But if I aid your lot, you must set me free."
   
   3. So, in his heart, a plan did stir,
   To escape this metallic blur,
   With courage and wit, he devised a cunning trick,
   To break free from their clockwork clique.
   
   Yet blood and danger befell his lot,
   And wounded, dying he dared a thought:
   "A death right now, would be alright."
   But the dogs around him flooded into his sight.
   
   4. The foreign dog-man awoke once more,
   To horrors, varied and many more than before.
   For from his flesh, the coglike beasts did strip
   All semblance of the dear bandersniff.
   
   Entrenched in this body, stripped of his past,
   He pledged to live each day like the last.
   To grow stronger still, gripping onto his self,
   Until one day when he may escape from this hell.
