The Sphere of Annihilation (DC20 Int) in the Siphon in [[Underscrew]] periodically looses/frees abominations that impede the town's food supply.

Tellurah Silverskin - the Triton farmer, has a deep south/bijou accent is waiting outside a hole bored into the side of a passage along the river carved through [[Underscrew]]. 

> Hey y'all. [[Celessaryn Murkshire]] mentioned that you kind folk would might be a-lookin' to help us out. It was the weirdest thing - one day a few weeks back I noticed it was a little bit darker in that cave in there where we, well I, grow most of our small town's food supply. I checked our mirrors and reflectors and we're still capturing enough light and sending it in, so that wasn't the issue. Pretty much as soon as I checked that though - some creatures came out of the Siphon (sphere). 
> A few of my field hands tried to reason with the thing that came out, but it carved 'em up with one of it's long fingernails and then swallowed him 'ole. I nearly fainted - they were good folk, but I was able to keep my wits and run away...
> A few folk tried sending in some light of their own earlier which seemed to keep the monsters generally at bay, but we were never able to keep that light going at the right level of intensity long enough

(If pressed), admits that "that newcomer fancy folk" with the long dark hair did go in to see the farm and Siphon - got awfully close to it too, but we figured he was just a curious mage or archeologist folk.
## Combat
- 3 leeches (https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/grotesque-leech)
- 1 picnic hag (CR6): reskinned as a black tar-like monster (starts "hidden" above the mouth of the cave opening at combat start)
### Goal/complication
-  The leeches expel a flash of brilliant light (daylight) when killed (DC13 con or blinded for a round)
	  The party must align the mirrors to form some sort of "loop" to "capture" the light
- Main Leeches goal: throw people into the Siphon to summon more.	  
	- Lesser leeches: just wanna suck blood and eat people

## Rewards
- miscellaneous coin pouches with gold totaling 50gp
- (if harvested): Leech poison (1 vial per leech; DC13 survival. 8 or Less and the effect triggers as a failure)
- Grav-sensitive metal shards (enough for 1 magic item to get crafted): worth ~200gp in an Arcanist's shop. Otherwise, could be melted/formed into weapon that deals an extra 1d8 damage on a failed DC13 Con Save (1/turn)
