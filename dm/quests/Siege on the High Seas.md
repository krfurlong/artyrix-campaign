[[The Reinvention]] are laying siege to the the entire island of [[Havangart]] as a result of the farmers/stewards ([[The Painted Turtles]]) of [[The Fermenti Caverns]] denying their exclusive trade demand to the Quyllurkuna Agaricus mushroom, which has the property of mimicking the effects of the Astral Projection spell at sufficiently high doses.

[[The Painted Turtles]] oversee the caverns, but do not believe the fungus within the caves belong to any one person or group. They defend this belief ardently, despite being relatively non-confrontational and pacificists in their own right: Many think the land and its resources are worth sacrificing for. They've drawn support from the locals of [[Havangart]], especially [[Simulcepio]] who share their concerns and some in [[Rifterra]] who are not as economically driven.
