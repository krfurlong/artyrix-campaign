**Premise**: There's an ongoing arms race between [[General Lutskyiv]] and Lord [[Arthur Tennyson]]. Both are avid funders of digs into [[The Endless Pits]], but Lutskyiv also supplements his militia with materials from abroad (works through [[Screwbloods]] on this to some extent). In an attempt to make a major breakthrough, Tennyson is conscripting/hiring an influx of diggers.
