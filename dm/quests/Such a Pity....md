**Premise**: There's an ongoing arms race between [[General Lutskyiv]] and Lord [[Arthur Tennyson]]. Both are avid funders of digs into [[The Endless Pits]], but Lutskyiv also supplements his militia with materials from abroad (works through [[Screwbloods]] on this to some extent). In an attempt to make a major breakthrough, Tennyson is conscripting/hiring an influx of diggers.

## Lutskyiv's Motivations

## Tennyson's Motivations

### History
[[Quzy Akone]] was engaged in largely petty crime for the few years after Kryst's departure. Got engaged with some gangs active in the Pits - [[The Scrapborn]], [[Sewer Scourge]], [[The Rust Crows]] - gained some decent reputation with them all and moved on without much bad blood, while earning some money that he funneled back to [[Destes Akone]], who used it to finance the tavern.

Things changed when he was in-between groups though and going on a deeper dive into [[The Endless Pits]]...more looking for clarity and purpose than anything, hoping for a miracle. 
He found first a viridian-silver colored gemstone that seemed to reflect and catch the light around him but _something_ spoke to him in that moment and he threw it down into the Pits.

A moment later, floating up from the Pit was **this** (pulls out a strange looking coin with an almost metallic looking gem embedded within it). From that point on, Quzy's streak of luck was incredible at the gambling table and in the Pits, whenever he was using the coin. He says it speaks to him and he tells stories of how it's our duty to protect the forces beneath us from those who was to press ever deeper.
	   _An ancient Electrum dragon (named [[Sigix]]) is the patron of Quzy/those who follow the coin, though Quzy does not fully know this to be the case._

## Quzy's Motivations
1. Quzy feels like this task from something literally more powerful than he could ever imagine has given him a purpose
2. Quzy is slightly motivated by feeling important to others and having a position of "power" among [[The Lost Change]]
3. He's slightly motivated by the idea of smoothing things over with [[Destes Akone]], and would love to have a closer relationship and to be able to pitch in and support her debt payments
4. Quzy **does not** like [[Arthur Tennyson]] and has grown increasingly antagonistic towards the 
### Goal
[[Sigix]] is growing increasingly weary of [[Arthur Tennyson]]'s forces and wants to deter them for good; 
Ideally, end vertical drilling in the Pits entirely if possible, by convincing them to push out horizontally instead.

[[Sigix]] worries that their years in captivity may leave them vulnerable to being trapped by other oppressors. While they yearn to be free and this indeed is a secondary goal they've voiced to [[Quzy Akone]], they urge caution and patience. They would rather remain trapped than be controlled and manipulated by others

## Endless Pits biomes
1. Level 1: Moss and fungus covered; [[The Scrapborn]] control ~75% of the level
2. Level 2: Glass & Clockwork; [[The Lost Change]] HQ ([[Quzy Akone]]); the [[Domain of Dogs]], and the [[Sands of Time]] (with [[Ritavis]], the sphinx)
3. Level 3: narrow, tall-tunneled strip mines riddled with swarming undead underneath; wooden slat bridges criss-cross the tops of these tunnels; [[The Rust Crows]] actively mine the space and clear pockets of undead to find anything glinting amid the roiling undead hoard
4. Level 4: Unclear if there's any ground at all here outside of the elevator stop; The level appears to be exclusively spider webs, guarded/managed by a deranged Muiral (https://krfurlong.github.io/bestiary/creature/muiral)
5. Level 5: _high_ fantasy-Wonderland themed; featuring logic puzzles (lewis carroll problems) that restrict access upon major thoroughfares, locking away some whispered about Jabberwok and an even more legendary blade that was said to wound it fiercely
	1. Also passing through the first logic puzzle is the tavern [[The Looking Glass]], which is positioned between planes of existence, bridging [[Havangart]] and [[The Endless Pits]]. Fighting is strictly prohibited, on account of the [[Tarrant Hightopp]], the barkeep (e.g., the Mad Hatter).
6. Level 6: A seedy aquatic level where murky water (oil-polluted/coolant area) is trapped in to form dark passages, and even darker alleyways; Run my the local [[Mobsta Lobstas]] 
	1. Family of the Silica Tribe
7. Level 7: Enflamed and polluted heart(stone); Devilish creatures run amuck - bartering and waylaying even the most intrepid of heroes
8. Level 8: Fossilized aquifer (dried up now); [[Arthur Tennyson]]'s forces have a secondary base here with a variety of diggers and other pieces of machinery
