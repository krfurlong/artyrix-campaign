> Contracting with [[Nivo Junctos]] on behalf of [[The New Transit]], the group seeks a way to break the siege of [[Havangart]].

Attendant outside the Viceroy's Villa (tiefling appearing named: Kaysar Greed), gives the group a once over and
1. asks for their credentials/anyone to vouch for them prior to entry -
2. additionally gauging whether they have a ship

> Entering the Viceroy's Estate proper, you all are quickly led to unfamiliar paths that seem to cross themselves without reason, leaving you all largely lost and turned around before finding yourselves at the end of a large foyer ending in two large wooden and iron accented doors.
> 
> Kaysar the attendant and assistant pushes one of these doors open slowly, before muttering inside: "One more interested party, Sir. They've come with some accolades (and a ship of their own)". A booming voice rings out - 
> Well send them in. We know not what secrets the waters may mask being their roiling waves - the more allies we have in our movements, the more likely we will taste success come a fortnight.

The room is a stretched rectangular, open along the opposite end to the Eternal Sea and entire town of [[Rusted Keys]] below. 
## Conditions
- Given the parties mixed history with aiding folks around [[Rusted Keys]], [[Nivo Junctos]] is generally unwilling to allow the group to join or tail the current fleet without payment upfront: 400gp per person to enter into a contract (see below). 
	- This fee increases to 600gp per person if they're seeking passage aboard one of the other vessels
- Additionally, sign a contract.
- Any spoils from breaking through the siege will be split evenly amongst the crew/vessels (e.g., 20% each)

### What they know
- Kato did a speed run on a sloop with a shoestring crew just over a week ago and saw "an impressive number of scrawny-looking ships - clogging up the northern waters around [[Rifterra]] and the northern marshlands."
	- Estimate: maybe a dozen vessels of a caravel design (e.g., smaller), but all looked like they'd taken a good bit of water damage and appeared to be in rough shape
	- Rumors from Tommy DeNice that vessels from [[Île Follette]] have witnessed larger numbers of forces assembling - could be more than a dozen by the time we get there
	- **Currently: 40 vessels assembled, [[The Fifth]] is the second largest, after a ghastly looking sloop-of-war [[The Chain-Gagged Maiden]] which arrived ~3 days earlier from the shores of [[Dynistia]].
- Kato and his scouts believe the siege has been an active embargo impeding incoming vessels but has been making scheduled trips into [[Havangart]].
	- Rumors on the Eternal Sea is that they're lookin' for something...or someone...
- Wreckage from skirmishes on the water have already left the area surrounding the siege dangerous in their own right - we'll need to carve through carefully or trigger 

## The Fleet
Nivo has pulled in connection of various ranking individuals among [[The New Transit]] to lead this effort already. 

4 warship (crew size of 20 each) already enlisted:
- Lead vessel:  [[Maelstrom's Fury]], with captain Tigris Auburn, svelte tabaxi - orange tiger coloration w/ a deep blue cloak
	- last
	- Laid back demeanor but very by the books when it comes to business
	- First mate: - triton Kato Blacksword Morris.
- Secondary: the [[Libra Shackleton]], conscripted out of [[Île Follette]] with the captain Tommy Nicely DeNice (human)
	- NYC/newsies accent
	- 1st
	- First mate: Rizzo del Vecchio - smooth talkin' greaser in grey/black leather armor
- Third: [[Nymphsong]] , with captain Lysandra Sirenis La Rose, sea elf.
	- Scheming and enterprising, to a fault. Looking to upend Kato's position as the favorite with viceroy
		- femme fatale vibes
	- First mate: Gemma Soapstone, female dwarf
	- 2nd position
- Last: The [[Cursed Cacti]] by [[Lorna Cookie Doone]] (Firbolg, mossy/algae theming, greenish/blue)
	- Newest transport from [[Charterstown]]
	- First mate: 
	- 4th position

## The Voyage - Random Encounters

**Rules: One person and the DM both roll a d6.**
	The DM's rolls _occurs_. The player may or may not see the thing occurring if 1 roll away.

Weather Roll:
- Clear day
- Overcast
- Light rain, windy
- Storming (penalty to Perception)

Random Events:
1. Dragon Turtle:
	1. The open seas before you today grow gradually more cluttered with pieces of debris and wreckage - the wood is not so water-logged that it had been adrift for long - you surmise you are on the right track and drawing ever closer. With this, you hear in the distance a soft sputtering - a deep gasp - (Perception to check direction).
	2. A large swell of water is directly behind you - a swell that seems to be moving ever closer - as another burst of vapor...no wait, it's steam...breaks out from the submerged form. You've seen a creature such as this before...
2. Slaver Vessel bound towards [[East Foundry]]
	1. A long boat filled with individuals from [[Linnæsa]] - maybe [[The Crash]]- who had fallen deep into debt are bound for indentured servitude at the hands of [[The Ascendent]].
	2. Captain is a bugbar named Gor-Moosh.
	3. Bugsy doesn't recognize the slaver captain although he's run in with his fair share of folk working on behalf of [[The Ascendent]] - not pleasant and quick to strike back...
3. Islet wreckage
	1. A small rocky outcropping catches some wreckage from a recent skirmish.
	2. It's slightly off the path and breaking off would cause some tension with ships in the Escort (DC 15 persuasion)
	3. Inv DC15 to find a decent sized coin purse (500gp) requires to be split equally amoungst the Escort...
	4. INV DC19 to find a small chest with 3 vials of Arcanist's Fire (3d6 - DC14 Dex Save for half). Fireball size
4. Large storm swells up
	1. Skill challenge - how do y'all batton up the hatches? DC15, 3 successes before 3 failures
	2. Failure: Mast Damage 5d10, hull damage 3d10, lost cannon/cannon balls.
5. Friendly merchant vessel - a small schooner led by [[Skipper Art Caraway]] (typical pirate accent). Hoped to dock in [[Flintpoint Harbor]] in [[Havangart]], but forced to navigate around it due to the siege
		- See bio for his wares
6. "Open Sea" Mimic
	1. Floating maybe 10 minutes off course you see what looks like a single small boat, one that could be an evacuation raft after a larger ship went down.
	2. Growing closer, a single person leans against a center post - their back to you and head lolled slightly forward - upon the post hangs a single lantern was swinging back and forth
	3. Dune Mimic stats
7. Locust crab swarm
	1. Scuttling over the surface of the water...you hear it far before you see them...thousands, maybe millions of pale red crabs clawing and scuttling over one another - consuming likely everything that gets in their way
	2. What do you do?
	3. Being aggressive towards the crabs as a group --> summons the crabstrocity.
	4. Left to their own devices, the crabs damage all ships: 4d10
8. [[The Reinvention]] Trader
	1. A single dark masted sloop on a shoestring crew sails quickly away from [[Havangart]]
		1. Captain: a tanned half elf named [[Sa'Juris]] hailing from and kareening back towards [[Dynistia]] with cargo of the moss from [[Corosiva]]. A note from the buyer in his possession in a fancy calligraphic script:
		> Sa'Juris, I care not for the meddlesome siege that now plagues the waters of [[Havangart]]: That is an arrow your lot has loosed upon your own limb and for which I am blameless. If the flora for which I have ordered and paid is not restocked as it has been for decades, all of our work shall be for naught and you shall lose a powerful ally in the East. Heed my words and warning - I shall not be tested. 

### Crossing through the sand atoll/mined strait

As you near [[Havangart]], the strong whiff of ozone fills your nostrils - overwhelming them momentarily as you and the deckhands on the ships in your small fleet. As you peer around, the wind picks up momentarily, flinging a piece of wood off the beach of a nearby sandbar island and whipping it into the waters just past the narrow strait in between the waters. As soon as the debris touches the water, it alights with a bright blue spark, catching fire and all but disintegrating to ash in a mere moment.

Along the shoreline of the nearside, you see 4 small and one longer rowboats seemingly abandoned and pulled up slightly onto the beach.
	A hidden message in a bottle is tossed aside next to one of these boats with puzzle tips:
		- You need 10 ships to overload the breaker and get through. Trying with less is a waste of time, using more than 10 is a fool's task and sure to blow you out of the water
		- The mines are proximity based but only trigger when you drop anchor next to them
		- Don't set down multiple anchors from different ship next to one another (or diagonal) or the current will run up the two lines and fry everyone onboard. 
		- The mine breakers have different thresholds before they turn off - red nodes need 2, orange need 1. Don't set up around green nodes - they need to be left alone.
		- Once triggered, the electric current will go down for about 20 minutes to recharge. Get your ships through and beach the smaller row boats for the next fleet to use.

## Beyond the Mined Atoll
> As your small fleet sails though the narrow strait, you finally - at last - begin to see the isle of [[Havangart]] truly begin to take form on the horizon. Approaching from the north-west, you already see the large mercantile city of [[Rifterra]] - with what you presume to be are large ships and tall pulley systems of the vast harbor. Obscuring and interceding this few however - are a dark line - a patrol - of ship. All similar in dark wooden and opaque gray designs, the long line of ships dart quickly across the horizon line between you and the island as they wait: searching for and expecting whatever likely force that may be forthcoming to attempt to carve a hole between the small island of [[Havangart]] and the vast outside world.


Upon crossing through the strait, 2 stealth checks for the Fleet to pass in
DC15 stealth check to avoid detection from the siege - upon failure, 2 patrol sloops, smaller but still foreboding, break off from the larger group of ships and quietly begin drifting towards the newcomers  

### Facts of the siege
- Roughly 40 ships in the siege of [[Havangart]] -
	30 were constructed and originally owned by [[The Reinvention]].
	10 that were captured in conflicts and are now pirated by members of the faction.
- Most (25) are caravel sized (e.g., Dat Aft) and intended for speed. 5 are slightly larger (Sailing Ships), 5 are true warships, and 5 are bonafide sloops-of-war.
- All ships bear the colors: [[the_reinvention_colors.png]]
