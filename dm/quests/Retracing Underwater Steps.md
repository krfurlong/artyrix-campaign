#quest 

## Background
[[Vee]] is a half-elven man who runs the pawn shop On the Fence in the Iron Filings District of [[Rusted Keys]]. He and his shop are affiliated with [[The Stallignment]], a criminal syndicate with loose connections to [[The Kismet]] in [[ÃŽle Follette]]. 
Vee commonly worked with [[Miranda Barnibas]] and her crew, and was the POC in [[Khiage]] with connections to [[Arthur Tennyson]] to employ them to steal scales from the dragon turtle who lives less than one ship's day away from [[Rusted Keys]]. 

Since the disappearance of [[Miranda Barnibas]] and the crew of [[The Black Lapis]], more orders have come in from [[Arthur Tennyson]] and less partisan ship builders based in [[Athenae]] for scales.
## Task
- Collect dragon turtle scales (total of 6 exist)
	- Collection must be done secretively as local officials - notably [[Aguatia Eryliften]] are strictly of the mind that collecting them will provoke the dragon turtle and lead to the city getting targetted
- Scales must be sold to Vee directly who will deliver to 2 buyers. Party may choose who they sell to:
	- Tennyson ready to compensate at 750gp per scale
	- [[Athenae]] buyer ready to compensate at 400gp per scale

## Complications
- Sailing north from [[Rusted Keys]] will attract attention from authorities, likely provoking an encounter with [[Inspector Vipric]], a dark blue/near black goblin employed by the [[The New Transit]] and his crew upon [[The Feral Cannibal]]
	- Proper documentation/clearance from [[Aguatia Eryliften]] required - or a conflict may arise
- Sailing to the area surrounding the nest takes 1 day
	- Room for a random encounter?
- It is deep underwater in the middle of open waters: 1000ft down, presenting clear challenges
	- once down there - minesweeper-esque puzzle to track down up to 6 scales
