A quest posted on the notice board in the Old Quarter in [[Faciv]].
## Background
The Court in [[Faciv]] frequently sends out missives (or debt installment requests) on the behalf of the wealthy denizens in the city who are owed money. The head cleric of the court, [[Pontif Rogana]], is a busy high-elf and sends adventuring groups out to collect the fees owed to his clients/fellow country-people.

The VanBeek Estate is a long-running, somewhat infamous family known across [[Corosiva]]. They have a reputation of actively tanking businesses to force them into foreclosure, purchasing the newly foreclosed property for bronze to the gold piece, and then turning around to place individuals to issue high-interest loans to want-to-be entrepreneurs into these properties. A vicious, but lucrative, cycle.

The missives have one catch: they are enchanted/mildly cursed under the effects of the Geas spell. Once issued the missive, the runner feels compelled to deliver the message as soon as possible. Moreover, upon finding the debtor, the runner is compelled to read the missive verbatim and collect payment _immediately._ If immediate payment is not obtained, the reading of a scroll triggers the summoning of a devil (Nergaliid-"devil toad") in 1 minute.

### Backstory Details
 Five years ago, [[Destes Akone]] (Kryst's sister) purchased [[The Shining Gem]] in [[Delver]] through one of these sub-par loan agreements
	- The first 4 years were profitable and she was able to stay ahead of the crippling payments but recent digs deeper into [[The Endless Pits]] have pushed increasingly hostile and formidable creatures - (relates to [[Building the Deep Bench]] questline)
## Quest
- [[Pontif Rogana]] works out of the court in the Old Quarter. Each missive delivered **and** completed secures the debt collectors 50gp, regardless the size of the debt payment. 
- Three missives need delivery and :
	- [[Destes Akone]] (dragon borne), proprietor of [[The Shining Gem]] in [[Delver]]
		- Owes past 2 months payments of 600gp each.
	- [[Carik Unir]] (drow), toll overseer of [[The Synaptic Highway]]
		- Owes 15% of past months tolls, estimated tolls at 2000gp, so owes 300gp.
	- [[Horace Hexshell]] (tortle) - a gambling addict and Pit delver living in a lean-to shack on the outskirts of [[Delver]] near the edge of [[The Endless Pits]].
		- Owes 250gp from past 3 months of rent (50gp, +50 x2 penalty from past missed payments)
