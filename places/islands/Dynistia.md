## History
The larger island of Dynistia was discovered comparatively late within the timeline of Artyrian history, particularly compared to many of the other prominent islands of the archipelago. From the time of its founding, however, the island managed to scare off roughly as many as it attracted. Unlike many of the other major islands of the region, Dynistia's geography features a large swath of land broadly deemed uninhabitable to most humanoids, on the account of a great desert that engulfs much of the western section of the island. While an errant oasis has been known to dot the landscape, and new ones occasionally spring up seemingly out of nowhere, the desert is predominantly empty of life - which, in turn, may explain the abundance of undeath that flourishes among, between, and underneath the endless dunes.
