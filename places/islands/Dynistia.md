## History
The larger island of Dynistia was discovered comparatively late in the [[Early Artyrian Timeline]] of  history, particularly compared to many of the other prominent islands of the archipelago. From the time of its founding, however, the island managed to scare off roughly as many as it attracted. Unlike many of the other major islands of the region, Dynistia's geography features a large swath of land broadly deemed uninhabitable to most humanoids, on the account of a great desert that engulfs much of the western section of the island. While an errant oasis has been known to dot the landscape, and new ones occasionally spring up seemingly out of nowhere, the desert is predominantly empty of life - which, in turn, may explain the abundance of undeath that flourishes among, between, and underneath the endless dunes.

The remainder of Dynistia is conversely - quite hospitable - and even encouraging of growth and civilization. Early settlers of this island included a small, but powerful, faction of druidic clerics. In their view, the desert landscape of the East was not a natural occurrence, but rather an artificial byproduct of a blighted land - a curse, perhaps - but something that tainted what was an otherwise healthy island. These early adventurers worked to carve a safe oasis away from the sands of the desert, and in doing so, founded the capital delta city of [[Sur'dame]] and inspired a generation of other young adventurers to take up the mantle and join them under the banner of the [[Order of the Shara]]. With the influx of support and power, the Order banded together and literally carved a deep gorge though the center of the island - separating the Eastern desert from the not-yet-corrupted western flank. Upon reaching the northern end of the island, the gorge flooded with water from the [[Eternal Sea]], thus creating the rapidly flowing [[River Txerys]].

In the years that followed, troupes from the Order of the Shara would spread out over the Western side of the island, establishing other dense metropolitan centers for economic and cultural activity. Simultaneously, other religious sects began trepidatiously arriving to Dynistia - taking advantage of the protective forces endowed by the River Txerys. While these groups shared a distain for the undead with the Shara, similarities between these factions were few and far between beyond that, driving infighting and a general atmosphere of tension nearly ever-present on the Western banks of Dynistia. Under the best circumstances, the religious groups and the Shara banded together to send their forces into the desert in military campaigns, though historians and military tacticians acknowledged even then that the objectives of these small-scale wars were muddled (at best) and (more likely) misguided and varied across the diverse factions encompassing the army of the [[Western Flank]].
