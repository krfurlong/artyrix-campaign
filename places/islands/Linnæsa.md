## History
The discovery of [[Linnæsa]] occurred relatively distinct from the other major islands of Artyrix, with the original settlers hailing from the *Wild Lands* region of [[Jolastokia]] as opposed to the brunt of settlers from Gataz. Due to enchantments native to the Wild Lands, the individuals from this region tended towards the more animalistic - literally; often times with features more akin to a beast than to what some may call the "civilized" and more advanced humanoid races. As such, the first denizens of Linnæsa were predominantly hybrid-entities, a handful of were-creatures, and other races with lineages that ran parallel to other woodland beings such as the noble leonin, the sly tabaxi, and the nimble harengon to name but a few. Over time, other races were attracted to the civil society and strong social order of trust and inclusion fostered among the people of Linnæsa, leading to an incredibly diverse population, if one that tended to skew more towards of _Animen_ ancestry.

Due to the more politically fragmented roots of the original settlers, large-scale institutions remained largely absent from early Linnæsan culture; with social structure instead stemming around highly organized factions, guilds, and trade groups. Some of the more prolific of these groups are listed below:
- [[The Husk]] 
- [[The Crash]]
- [[The Business]]
- [[The Sleuth]]
- [[The Parliament]]

These factions lived largely in peace - sometimes a brokered peace set in place by contracts drafted by the Business - but a peace nonetheless. However, conflict truly first came to the island with the arrival of the entity known as [[ESC]]. ESC first garnered the attention of members of the Sleuth, who welcomed them to setup a small laboratory in [[Ruddy Rock]] in the [[Darwin Marshes]], in hopes of learning from their advanced artifice techniques. In time, ESC's inventions began spreading across the island, yet much of the population grew increasingly wary of these mechanical contraptions over which ESC seemed to exert significant control.

In an unprecedented act, an awkward alliance was struck between leadership in [[The Husk]], [[The Crash]], and [[The Parliament]], each of which harbored their own reasons of wanting ESC and their inventions cast out from [[Linnæsa]]. This alliance was countered by an offshoot group from [[The Sleuth]], who remained interested in learning from the skilled artificer and inventor; and a cadre from [[The Business]], who were interested in monetizing and mass-producing ESC's inventions. The ensuing conflict came to be known as the [[Animen Extradition]] and consisted of a series of skirmishes between ESC's weaponized inventions alongside some offshoot support from the denizens of [[Linnæsa]] against an incredibly organized force led by the Husk, Crash, and Parliament factions. This group moved quickly and decisively, resulting in the expulsion of [[ESC]] from [[Linnæsa]] in a matter of months - after which the exiled inventor traveled to [[Delta Prime]] to continue their work.

At the conclusion of the [[Animen Extradition]], life on [[Linnæsa]] tried to return to normal, yet trust between the factions was largely fractured, much to the dismay of [[The Parliament]]. [[The Husk]], under the leadership of a grizzled harengon only know by their moniker [[Big Bunny]], took a particularly aggressive stance - assuming political control of a "unified" [[Linnæsa]] with the military backing of [[The Crash]]. With this control and source of brute force, [[Big Bunny]] began persecution of their rivals - starting with the offshoot rebels who initially supported [[ESC]]; however, these reactions quickly spread to anyone even suspected of harboring ill-will towards [[The Husk]]. This paranoia continues to this day - though the memories of the [[Animen Extradition]] have largely faded in the decades since this conflict.
