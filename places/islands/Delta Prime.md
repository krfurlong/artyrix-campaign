## History
The island of Delta Prime - and the surrounding lessor islands of [[Delta Major]] and [[Delta Minor]] - were discovered almost entirely by accident. Facing persecution and likely exile from their mechanical experimentation on [[Linnæsa]], the inventor only known by their initials [[ESC]] fled into the [[Eternal Sea]] under the impression they were traveling west towards [[Corosiva]]. Navigation not being the bookish individual’s strong suit, they did not realize their mistake until their vessel was almost entirely destroyed by the chaotic storms and currents of the western Eternal Sea. One hastily cast Find the Path spell later, and ESC flung themself from their now sinking ship and frantically started swimming towards the closest body of land in the vicinity. It was under these turbulent, if fortuitous, circumstances that the island of Delta Prime was first settled.

Historical accounts on specifics get murky after this point. By all onlooker accounts, however, [[ESC]] leaned into their extensive skillset quickly upon arrival, leading to a period of rapid development across the island, the era later deemed the [[Reinforcement]]. When the next recorded visitors to the island arrived a few years later, a small group of advocates and former students of ESC, word quickly spread that ESC had effectively replicated life in multiple forms through machinery and created a self sustaining biome on the primary island. Constructs and other mechanical attendants were numerous beyond count, and attended to every reasonable whim voiced by any living humanoid.

To the dissatisfaction of ESC and their followers, the period of the [[Reinforcement]] gradually gave way to what later came to be know as the [[Drift]]. Things did not sour immediately - or even perceptibly at first. A simple command that was at one time followed without question gradually needed repeating by the part of the humanoids. Constructs with once consistent and reliable features began appearing without key capabilities - instead leveraging self-modifications to do tasks previously unimaginable. Sentry constructs gradually became less and less effective at mitigating the errant creature blown in by the wild winds of the Eternal Sea.

And yet, this slow change was broken so sharply by a rapid escalation of machine intelligence. Unified under a single entity known only as [[Composis]] from rumors first coalescing in the dense urban factory lands of [[Delta Minor]], the technocratic leadership of ESC and their followers was ousted almost immediately as their constructs turned on them without warning. Fleeing for their lives, ESC and most of their advisors escaped from [[Delta Prime]] to the until then-uninhabited  island of [[Delta Major]] to the north. This changing of the guard - so to speak - ushered in what came to be known as the [[Beta Era]], which continues to this day.
