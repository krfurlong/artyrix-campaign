## History
The island of Machivelia was the first notable landmass discovered and subsequently lived on by the original settlers from [[Jolastokia]]. Due to the clear history drawing a direct connection between the two, many cultural and political structures which existed in Jolastokia - and in particular the city of [[Gatazka]] - were neatly mapped onto early Machivelian society. This includes an acceptance of most deities, spanning the [[Artyrian Pantheon]], though in Machivelia in particular, the boundaries separating mortal and the divine always seemed a bit less concrete - or at least, that is what the nobles seemed to believe.

Regrettably, Machivelia also inherited many of the institutional woes that plagued the early conflicts of [[Gatazka]]. In Machivelia, these conflicts often took the form of large-scale disputes over the nature of power: who should wield it, what laws or moral guidelines should dictate the actions of the powerful, and to what extent should rulers seek to expand their rule. Disputes, conflict, and even small scale wars broke out frequently during the years immediately following the island's founding, leading many including [[Captain Flint]] and others to quickly flee the isle in search of more peaceful lands. 

After decades of conflict, however, a recent - if tenuous - form of peace has emerged between the three established states of [[Machivelia]]. This peace formalized the borders between the three nation-states posturing for power leading to three distinct regions with a shared capital city, [[Vecchia]], positioned at the intersection of the three:
1. The eastern-most state of [[Garnetscar]] spans both mountainous and desert-covered terrain stretching from the eastern coast to the [[Myrkvad River]] was settled and ruled by primarily dwarves, goblins, gnolls, snerfneblin (sp?), lizard-folk, and dragon borne as many of their cities either were built into the rolling hills surrounding the desert or underneath the sand itself. 
2. The north-western state of [[Dellavolpe]] largely consisted of elves and gnomes, shifters and aarakocra, bugbears and tabaxi as the region was dominated by large forests and woodland regions. Leveraging their talents and lack of fear of heights, the people of [[Dellavolpe]] built enormous structures into and between the trees of the forests - seldom emerging from them unless the moment was precisely ripe for them to strike.
3. The south-western state of [[Athenae]] largely drew the attention of humans, halflings, tritons, and genasi as it tended to be the most adventurous and maritime oriented state of the island. Life in [[Athenae]] depended on trading with other cities across the state - and even across the [[Eternal Sea]], leading the state to drive advancements in technology, particularly as it pertained to weapons that might be strategically positioned on a seafaring vessel. 

The peace itself was brokered by no small feat by a troupe of mages all hailing from the same magical academy in [[Vecchia]], the [[Arcanum Decetto]]. Working tirelessly, students from the school returned to their respective hometowns and states - grinding day after day in low-level political appointments before eventually reaching advisory positions of note. Once in position, mages in all three states began advocating publicly and consistently for peace: at first in closed-door sessions but later in increasingly public displays of posturing. In time, the masses fell in line behind the message of peace being preached by these arcane advisors who came to be known (collectively) as the [[Sagezza]]. From that point, a truce was brokered and the conflicts largely ended as soldiers returned home, leaving the fighting to any poor bureaucrat serving their post amid the great halls in [[Vecchia]].
