## History
Unintentionally discovered by [[Captain Flint]] en route to [[Khiage]], the small island of Havangart quickly grew into a key trading hub in Artyrix. Havangart’s maritime roots and its unique position between the island of corsairs and [[Machivelia]] to the East attracted the attention of many an enterprising capitalist. Much to these individuals chagrin, however, the natural ecology of the island hinted at its other intentions.

Unbeknownst to Flint and his crew at the island’s founding, Havangart was more than a convenient midpoint between the trade routes. Flora on the island prospered - both above ground and below it - and some unique mix of chemical compounds or divine fate left most things native to the isle with distinct psychotropic effects. First settlers made this discovery on accident as the group collectively experienced a hallucinogenic trip lasting nearly two days after they all enjoyed what they assumed was mundane honey. Other fruits from native trees yielded similar effects: a complex mix of lethargy, euphoria, and, in some cases, self-discovery and enlightenment. 

From that point, the trajectory of Havangart was set into motion. Scores upon scores of artists and “naturalists” flocked to the island to partake of the spiked agriculture, with some enjoying more responsibly than others. Businesses opened up on the island to support the growing holistic healing and eco-tourism industries, which attracted an entirely different demographic of island residents. Over time, scientists, mages, and botanists conducted precise ecological studies of the island, prompting key breakthroughs in the brewing of magical healing potions and other substances capable of channeling and enhancing one’s nascent abilities. In short, the island blossomed into a key economic, cultural, and strategic hub, which its denizens embraced then, and continue to foster to this day.
