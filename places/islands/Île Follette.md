## History
The isle of [[ﾃ四e Follette]] was settled perhaps 20 years following the solidification of the [[Velian Houses]] on [[Machivelia]]. Frustrated by being effectively cut out of the power structure on that island, groups of settlers fled to discover ﾃ四e Follette, decreeing that this land would not be bound to the whims of the aristocracy - but rather be led by the consent of the people. As the Fates would have it, these early founders and shrewd politicians succeeded in their objectives - and it grew into something far greater and far more grotesque than they could have ever imagined.

The founders of [[ﾃ四e Follette]] set forth two simple rules around which they intended to build their new society:
1. Elections for the Leader of the island shall occur on the first day of each new year
2. Each person physically present on [[ﾃ四e Follette]] on the day of elections is entitled participate in the election
