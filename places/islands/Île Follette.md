## History
The isle of [[Île Follette]] was settled perhaps 20 years following the solidification of the [[Velian Houses]] on [[Machivelia]]. Frustrated by being effectively cut out of the power structure on that island, groups of settlers fled to discover Île Follette, decreeing that this land would not be bound to the whims of the aristocracy - but rather be led by the consent of the people. As the Fates would have it, these early founders and shrewd politicians succeeded in their objectives - and it grew into something far greater and far more grotesque than they could have ever imagined.

The founders of [[Île Follette]] set forth two simple rules around which they intended to build their new society:
1. Elections for the Leader of the island shall occur on the first day of every fifth year.
2. Each person physically present on [[Île Follette]] on the day of elections is entitled participate in the election

Armed with this blazingly straight-forward pair of laws, Ile Folletten society sprinted into the throes of incredulous growth. Cities rapidly sprung up around previously uninhabited country-side. Immigrants flocked to the island - drawn by the new economic opportunities and the promise of a say in the political direction of the nation. Factions rose and fell in popularity as over time, a cadre of true political philosophies emerged as ever-present and dominant amongst the populous. These parties stemmed from the ancient traditions and factions present in Sigil, yet due to the time and interplanar separating these new ideologies from their source, they changed. Imperceptible at first, yet over time maturing and permutating into unique belief systems all their own. The dominant parties - and their original inspirations - are as follows:

1. [[The Ascendent]] (Minds' Eye)
2. [[The Defiant]] (Athar)
3. [[The Kismet]] (Fated)

These three parties roughly accounted for 80% of the public's support - with votes tending to be equally split between the three. Due to this lack of a plurality, dealings and bargains were constantly being struck between these leaders and key figures from the lesser parties, listed below:
1. [[The Open Hand]] (Bleak Cabal)
2. [[The Orinoco]] (Society of Sensation)
3. [[The Instinct]] (Transcendent Order)

And finally, bouts with chaos and significant political uprisings in the first instances of [[Île Follette]] practicing its election processes led to slight, but notable, restrictions on certain types of parties. Specifically, [[The Riggers]] (inspired by the Hands of Havoc) were promptly barred from organizing due to their creed effectively centered around the notion that they should infiltrate the other parties to overturn them from the inside. Similarly, [[The Sleepwalkers]], which drew from the teaching of the Heralds of Dust, faced more severe punishment in the form of banishment from the isle on the account of their propensity for publicly assassinating their political opponents and then speaking to those in grief as if they had been done a great service. While the doctrine of [[Île Follette]] technically forbid the absolute banning of both these political organizations, those found to be members - or even sympathetic - to these parties were _heavily_ ostracized and faced near constant physical, social, and economic persecution.

### Current Politics
In the most recent bout of elections, an outsider named [[Tethis Rosevale]] from [[The Instinct]] Party captured the attention of the masses and a tenuous backing of some from the dominant tier of parties, notably from [[The Defiant]] and [[The Kismet]]. With a surprising amount of charm and candor for one from [[The Instinct]], Tethis's coalition government took unprecedented steps to govern the extremities of the island, shifting the political focus away from the enormous metropolitan, central capital city of [[New Sigil]] and towards the four arms of the island where most of the population lives comparatively normal, calm lives - outside of the heavy presence and oversight of the dominant parties. These populist policies tried, among other things, to decentralize power out of [[New Sigil]], by standing up regional government centers in the [[Outer Counties]]; however, these policies did not go without some objections, as some viewed this encroachment of capital power into the [[Outer Counties]] as displacing the existing power structure set in place by the Parties.
