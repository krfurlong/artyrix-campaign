## History
Relative to almost all of the other islands of Artyrix, very little is known about the Northern Barrier Islands. Presumed to have been formed as by products in some cosmic event by logicians and powerful mages, leading theories suggest that the sweeping island chain may have been formed after a large asteroid  impacted the plane, sending shattered fragments of itself around the [[Eternal Sea]]. Others hypothesize that giants and titans may have formed them centuries before even the first explorers from Sigil entered the plane through the gate in [[Jolastokia]]. Regardless, its origin remains unconfirmed and shrouded in mystery - and these unknowns drive much of the interest, perceived exoticism, and public intrigue in the islands.

The intrigue surrounding the origin of the Northern Barrier Islands attracted the attention of avid mariners, often times departing from the shipyards in [[Khiage]] and of merchants who tended to departs in large maritime convoys from [[Havangart]]. These mercantile expeditions sought out to map and chart the riches hidden amongst the chain of islands, yet they proved to be effectively unprofitable. While the calm, tropical climate of the region endeared itself to crews of these vessels, their captains remained frustrated by the apparent lack of riches. The region did seem to exhibit strange arcane tendencies, with islands disappearing and reappearing in the span of weeks, though sometimes in different positions and other times not seeming to reappear at all.

After decades of waning interest in the beautiful, but largely uninspired islands, two different groups of people were drawn to the island chain in a more permanent and intentional sense. Firstly, a small cadre of artificers from [[Delta Prime]] and [[Delta Major]] landed on one of the northern-most islands in the aftermath of the [[Beta Revolution]], founding the town of [[Searidge Station]]. Over time, other inventors and mages were drawn to [[Searidge Station]] on account of the scientific activities underway by these artificers, specifically exploring how the tides and ley-lines of the [[Eternal Sea]] might be leveraged to further arcane enchantments and advancements in spellcraft. 

The second group sprung up shortly thereafter by an enterprising member of [[The Business]] (from [[Linn√¶sa]]) who set out to establish a sister-resort to one of the most popular villas in the [[Bindo Lagoon]], the [[Bindo Bungalows]]. This individual succeeded in this endeavor, somehow anchoring the entire island in place and preventing the tides and whims of the [[Eternal Sea]] from shifting its position, and in doing so, founded the resort town/island of [[Sunset Cove]]. After a few years of intense marketing campaigns, [[Sunset Cove]] did indeed garner an equal, if not more, exquisite reputation than the Bungalows, becoming **the** go to vacation spot for the rich, famous, and powerful from across Artyrix.
