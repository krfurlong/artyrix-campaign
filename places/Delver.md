## History
The scrap city of Delver grew out of the need for some semblance of organization and governance over the region immediately surrounding the primary dig-site on [[Corosiva]]. It's a chaotic, market-centric town that to the untrained eye could pass off as a well-organized junkyard. Piles of discarded metals, tangles of stripped wires and cords, and empty vessels that once contained consumable substances are littered around the town. Some more enterprising folks use the trash itself as a building material, which speaks to the pervasiveness of the junk and the transiency that people expect to reside in Delver.
