[[Aoife]]'s hometown on the island of [[Havangart]]

![[simulcepio.png]]

## Key Town NPCs
1. [[Lord Maris]] - anthropomorphic otter and unofficial mayor of the town. He resides near the junction of the two rivers, tongue-in-cheek refers to his home as Triverside Estate
2. [[Patsy]] - a southern-twanged human that volunteers as clerk of the town. It's fundamentally unclear if there's even enough logistical work going on to warrant needing a clerk and the general sense is she's just here for the gossip and small-talk
	1. Blockhouse
	2. Townhall
3. [[Hounga Kalfou]] - island resident, spiritual leader/shaman figure, does he live forever? Perhaps.
