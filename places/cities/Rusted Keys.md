## History
The Rusted Keys is a relatively newer large town - springing up almost out of necessity under the overwhelming growth of [[Charterstown]] to the west. Due to [[Charterstown]]'s land-locked location, resources were quickly diverted to the Keys to build up an impressive marina that could be able to support the necessary economic activities driving southern [[Khiage]]'s ambitions.
## Places of Interest
1. Eros Marina: a peninsula built up to be 270 degrees of functional dock-space for ships ranging from galleon to sloop
	1. Marina: run by an elven female: [[Aguatia Eryliften]] - kind and has been around here forever. Knows her stuff, isn't going to get ripped off by anyone.
	2. The Sand Dollar Saloon - a run down bar, popular amongst the sailors and pirates coming in and out of the region. Popular bardic troupe venue given that the owner is a former player (piano/honkytonk) himself, a human man in early 60's named [[One-Handed Hal]]. 
	3. Bosun's Bar - a well-maintained, wooden-interior establishment that isn't pegged to the ground, resulting in it floating/bobbing with the waves and current. It's run by a married triton couple: Njor and Rugia Caspia. (swedish sounding)
2. Iron Filings District: The old town, existed long before the Corrosive Sprawl and Vista were developed - somewhat run down because of the shift in focus to other districts. Mixed mercantile and residential
	1. Peggie's Post: a kenku purveyor who goes by the name Peggie maintains an aviary full of macaws, capable of flying vast distances to deliver messages and small packages
	2. The Dusty Docks - a much run down set of docks, generally thought to be used by those who want to remain under the radar or out of sight. 
		1. Managed by dockhand (gnome): [[Ferbin Bubblesnooker]]
	3. Evember Forge - a multi-generational family-run forge, currently under the ownership of the 4th generation dwarf (female), Phosforia Oreweaver
		1. Specializes in jewelry, but more often required to work on weaponry
		2. Antagonistic towards the industrial smiths in the North Forge, claims they are soft, esp the head smith, a sicky pale looking human named [[Ralph Twillhand]]. 
	4. [[On the Fence]] - a pawn shop and run by a tanned half-elven man, [[Vee]]. 
3. Corrosive Sprawl
	1. Oxi-Date Tavern: a slightly more upscale, but cringe restaurant/bar, themed? Managed by an underpaid halfling: Sammy Skipperfoot
	2. Western Warehouses: a tight collection of buildings and large rows/stacks of materials, a hub of transit between the docks in the Eros Marina and the roads to [[Charterstown]]. Run by a mountain dwarf: [[Horic Ironwrote]]
	3. 
4. Viceroy's Vista: the newest addition to the town, the Vista is built on the edge of the cliff - overlooking the [[Eternal Sea]] and the lower districts of [[Rusted Keys]]. It very much resembles a fort, of traditional Caribbean/Iberian design - rectangular stone parapets stand between the commoners and the open air plazas of lighter terracotta where the rich and new aristocracy spend their days
	1. Viceroy's estate: French estate with precisely manicured gardens where the Viceroy, a goliath named [[Nivo Junctos]], hailing originally from [[Machivelia]] in [[Garnetscar]]. He earned this post - rising through the ranks and proving he was an expert tactician and logistics manager within the ranks of [[The New Transit]]. 
		1. Record keeper: old gnome woman [[Quilla Scribblescribe]]
	
	2. Cyano Casino: a surprisingly high-rolling casino, sophisticated, and entertaining enough to capture the attentions of the aristocracy who reside nearby
	3. Other upper-class folks in this region:
		1. Owlin aristocrat/diplomat from [[Linn√¶sa]] - [[Strigidye]], sent to engage [[The New Transit]] regarding their plans on [[Khiage]] and external negociations
		2. Deep gnome from [[Corosiva]] - specifically [[Faciv]]. Representative for [[Arthur Tennyson]] and coordinating their train construction southward from [[Charterstown]]
		3. A bronze dragonborne - [[Zarabi]] of [[Garnetscar]] in [[Machivelia]], providing travel/transportation recommendations for traversing the southern desert regions of [[Khiage]]. A close ally of [[Nivo Junctos]] given their common background
