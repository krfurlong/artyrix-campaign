## Description and Narrative
Upon exiting the hubbub of the port and harbor, you all gaze ahead of you and upward to a sight largely unfamiliar to the majority of you. Before you, perched on top of what seems to be a mossy and strangely patterned plateau is what you can only assume to be the large city of [[Faciv]]. As you draw slightly nearer to the city, following the path of merchants and the only road in sight, your eyes adjust and realize the patterns at the distance are not cosmetic, but rather the plateau itself is _threaded_ like an enormous screw - with grooves so wide that you begin to clock and follow movement of peoples and carts as they slowly follow the circular grooves ever upward until reaching the top: the city of [[Faciv]] itself.
