The island of Corosiva is less of a landmass and more of a semi-metallic, semi-organic structure that emerged from the [[Eternal Sea]] after spending years hidden from civilization. 

According to local historians and mages, titanous machines once inhabited this region of Artyrix. For one reason or another, these machines fell into disrepair or were destroyed, leaving their metallic shells littered around the world. While some religious cults still exist today believing that these great machines will one day arise out of the Eternal Sea, most others of Artyrix believe these constructs are gone for good.

Many individuals flocked to the mossy, over-grown, and slightly rusted island of Corosiva upon realizing that it was - in fact - a pair of connected hexagonal screws from one of these enormous machines. Excitement over Corosiva only intensified when early explorers discovered the landmass of the island was still connected to the original titan, though the bulk of the figure still remained submerged and stretched fathoms below the Sea. However, artificers and archeologists alike were keen to begin excavating the exposed, if rusted over, former body of the machine. These excavators were quick to uncover fascinating advanced technologies and precious metals among other valuable resources housed within the ever expanding dig site. The site soon grew so larger that it took on another name, [[The Endless Pits]], as over the years, individuals were forced to press ever deeper into the depths of the pit in order to find the resources once discovered closer to the surface. These expeditions, of course, grew increasingly risky from the extended periods now required to simply get to the unexploited parts of the machine - and from other individuals who, driven by scarcity and greed, were known to commit unspoken attrocities deep in the Pits: a place where even one's reverberating screams cannot be heard by the  world above.
