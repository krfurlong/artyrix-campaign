#faction 

An inquisitive group, membership in the Sleuth includes a great deal of exploration and rugged living. Generally situated in the northern regions of the [[Darwin Marshes]] and the [[Aladien Ice Patch]], individuals in the Sleuth are often drawn out of their hometowns and encouraged to seek out new mysteries to better understand the world around them. To support this endeavor, they've grown into skilled engineers, often times inventing or improving many of the most common means of transportation found across [[Linn√¶sa]] using largely naturalistic magics and materials. These pursuits often require larger infrastructure such as that more common in cities (e.g., not on the road), so over time, members of the Sleuth congregated and formalized a small city in the [[Darwin Marshes]] called [[Ruddy Rock]] to support these larger projects. They value novelty, curiosity, and individualism more so than any other group on the island - are are similarly most likely to be found on the other islands of Artyrix.
