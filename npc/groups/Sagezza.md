#faction 

A mage faction, generally populated by those who studied at or preside over the [[Arcanum Decetto]] in [[Vecchia]] on the island of [[Machivelia]]. The wizards, sorcerers, clerics, and others of this highly esteemed cohort historically valued and espoused peace, diplomacy, and collaboration over conflict. In the years following the Interstate War, participation in the [[Sagezza]] extended beyond the island - although the true center of power of the institution remains vested in the mages of [[Machivelia]].
