#faction

First formally organized within the interior of [[Linn√¶sa]] (generally referred to as the [[Verdant Acres]]), members of the faction were largely agrarian and thrived among the vast farmlands that proliferated this region. They value hard work, dedication, honesty, and transparency in all things. They also tend to subscribe to a degree of mysticism and/or religious fervor, possibly due to their proximity to the erratic [[Emerald Volcano]].
