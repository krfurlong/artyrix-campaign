## Original Clann Na Cursa
-  [[Aine McPhee]] (AWN-yah) and  [[Cairan O’Shananhan]]: (plays concertina, writes, sings a little)  (sings, dances, writes music with Cairan Sang folky music that tell stories with a dark end (think Grimm Fairy tales) or a dark moral, Feywild inspired
- [[Nerida]] (NEH-ree-dah) a mermaid told stories by swimming through water that her water genasi lover, named [[Mizu]], creates for her, belly dancing vibes, dark twist, she only tells stories through dance because her tongue was cut out. Sailors thought she was a siren and wanted to prevent her from seducing them through song.
- Three dwarven siblings (two male and one “bearded lady”) who tell stories through taiko drummer on anvils, the sparks from the anvil, their movements, and chanting tell stories mostly inspired by Dwarven history, and present (Dwarven Civil War) All three are fleeing conscription into the war and were branded with Moradin’s hammer on their left forearms even though they’re not followers of Moradin
- Chen family, elven, two adults and their two children, [[Zhuli Chen]] (older girl) and [[Jamie Chen]] (non-binary and Aoife’s good friend) the adults (Maggie and Wei) tell stories using mostly illusion based magic they always started the show as well are provided a lot of the “special effects” for other performances. The stories they tell warn that the things that make us unique (like using magic) can also lead to persecution and isolation. People fear what they do not understand. Don’t believe everything you see.
- Safa (sa-FA), older darker skinned human woman and her daughter, [[Soneela]] (Aoife’s friend)
	- Safa would read palms and tarot for audience members before the troupe’s performance would begin. She only has one hand as a result of being caught as a thief when she and Soneela lived in the streets of a city
- Kobold tumblers / acrobats, don’t let your art be used for the system. They were a small piece of a bigger picture and they didn’t see what their actions were doing. The message is that industry and capitalism are destroying our natural world and art for art’s sake. The Chen family often add effects to this act. 
- Kenku “barker” goes by the name Abe
- [[Melrakki]] - A straight up kitsune…fox like creature that looks like a Nine Tails, cute as hell and can shapeshift into a human.
## Clann Na Cursa (now), minor changes to the "old crew"
- Chen family - [[Jamie Chen]] and [[Zhuli Chen]] still tumble. [[Zhuli Chen]]'s actually had triplets in the time since and the group of them are ~4 years old (Renn, Pei, and Tzeng) and pretty darn talented in their own right
	- Maggie and Wei are "retired" and incredibly supportive grandparents
	- Some of the kobolds were folded into their crew as a unified act
- Safa ([[Soneela]]'s mom) passed peacefully maybe a year ago - she was reading tarot up until the day she left us according to [[Soneela]] and had favorable readings for the 6 weeks leading up to her last breath
	- [[Soneela]]'s filled in her mom's role as tarot reader but has also pulled on some new skills as shadow-singer and spirit caster; grown adept in keying in on people's past helping them come to terms with their demons (literal and metaphorical)

### New acts
- Pierre Nonsecrete - a young elven teenager who is a mime
	- In true mime fashion, the things he pantomimes become real whenever he's performing - so he's always chitchatty whenever he's _not_ on stage.
	- Traumatic past includes a moment when his parents died trapped in a burning building because he inadvertently sealed them inside when he was choking on smoke and unable to speak
- Panorama "Pan" Carter - a female chronomancer dancer, her act involves splitting herself into past, present, and future and dancing with herself (a la a looper in music)
	- Main act is one that depicts an enslaved woman who is only freed upon leaping out of a window and realizing her inner-druidic powers
	- Act features a 5ft tall metronome that helps her sync up the act
	- Early malfunctions to her act resulted in her leaping off a precipitously high location and missing her mark in space-time, which resulted in her having to go further forward in time to correct her mistake.
		- As a result, she had to watch herself "die" over and over again
