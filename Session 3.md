Title: ?
<hr>

> You all emerge from the long tunnel exiting the volcano - You were not inside of it long, though even in the few hours since delving inward, the temperature and humidity of the island swelled substantially, and it only takes but a moment upon your departure from the dry volcanic vent until your clothes once again begin uncomfortably sticking to your back and sagging with the weight of the tepid air.
> Among this early afternoon heat, you feel a definitive rumble beneath your feet - followed by a rush of hot air whipping up from behind you, presumably coming from the geothermic nexus that you recently left behind.

_(The volcano kicks  up a large plume of brackish, yellow smoke...)_

## Situation
- Boat is hidden among the jungle here on Hex15. It takes an hour to travel there during which time volcanic activity on the island continues to intensify
	- Searching the jungle takes 1 hour - DC18 Investigation check to find
	- Thick vines lay across the small hull of a sloop (retractable mast and sail)
		- https://www.dndbeyond.com/vehicles/keelboat --> Sloop  stats, but vulnerable to fire, and everything has half as many hitpoints, and is size huge (10 ft by 20ft)
	- Aggression vs vines could start a combat:
		- Assassin vine + 2 vine vipers.
	- Jungle leads to a sheer 120ft cliff. No evidence/hints as to how it got there/up from the water...
		- Apart from a large indent/impact point of the hull (slight damage if looked into)
- Sloped descent downward either following along the beach to the east or west
	- East goes towards Teg, the Lake Troll
	- West goes towards a rather precarious swamp

### Leaving through the Swamp
> Journeying westward towards what you only presume to be the lowlands, the ground beneath you gets softer and more most: gradually at first, but increasingly sopping wet as you carry the boat to water. 

- **Constitution Check: DC13 or suffer 1 point of exhaustion**

> After ~45 more minutes of walking, the slope beneath you finally levels out - as you find yourselves most definitively in a marshy bog. This swamp land, in fact, is the only thing between you and the ocean, visible just past the bare bushes and trees that dot this decrepit landscape

- Skill Challenge - How do you cross the swamp? 
	- 120 ft to cross until the land gives way to beach.

Things that are visible/noticeable before beginning:
- Weirdly circular holes at 15ft, 60ft, 75ft, 95ft...
- "Sunken trees" - a large oak tree appears to have sunken into the bog perhaps 50 ft in - the tops of its branches are visible emerging from the ground at odd angles  
- Some pooled, brackish water in two places: 40ft and 105ft
	- No quicksand/risk of sinking but Con Save or pick up diseased condition
- Groups of mushrooms of many colors (eating something that's decaying) - 15ft, 70ft, 85ft
- Misc bushes scattered throughout - those closer to water pools are oddly more dead than the others

Complications (in order of badness)
- Exposed to badwater - Con Save DC12 for disease
- Quicksand - Req strength check 12 to pull self out, but DC increases by 2 for each failed attempt
	- After 1st round: 1d4 x number of rounds bludgeoning from weight of the sand
- Beetles of unusual size
- A rogue adamantine worm :o
- Mushrooms that release spores that mimic the confusion movement condition
### Escaping across the plateau
> Description...

- Magma Mephit encounter: - Territorial (king + 2 embued).
	- King is interested in spreading fire - (somewhat in deference to [[Lord Emberfall]])
	- Party could potentially avoid conflict with some successful persuasion (a la setting other things on fire; branding themselves?)

> Description of nearing edge of plateau ~1 hour later, more magma running off the size of the volcano; Teg's modest stone house comes into view


- Large crane/pulley operator positioned at the side of the cliff. 
	- 3 unlabeled cranks
		- 1 goes up/down
		- 1 that controls left/right
		- 1 goes 1 open/closes the clamp at the end
		- 1 opens the bottom out of the platform
		- Also: 3 buttons that "lock" each of the settings above?
	- 25 by 25 ft in size platform at the base of the 100ft cliff
